how can i look inside the databases with psql
# ChatGPT
Use `\c &lt;dbname&gt;` to connect, then `\dt` or `\d` to inspect contents:


```sh
\c supertokens    -- connect to the database
\dt               -- list tables
\d tablename      -- describe table schema
SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 10;  -- peek into data
```


You can also:


- `\dn` for schemas
- `\dv` for views
- `\di` for indexes

Keep it scoped‚ÄîPostgres can get noisy fast.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
look inside a table
# ChatGPT
Once connected (`\c dbname`), do:


```sql
\d+ tablename           -- show table schema with size, defaults, etc.
SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 10;  -- show first 10 rows
```


Need specific columns?


```sql
SELECT id, email FROM users LIMIT 10;
```


Want structure *and* data inline?


```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'tablename';
```


Use `\x` for expanded display if rows are wide.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
all the select * queries return nothing
# ChatGPT
If `SELECT * FROM tablename` returns no rows:


1. **Double-check the table actually exists and is non-empty:**

```sql
\dt               -- list tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename;
```
2. **Check schema context:**
Postgres might be defaulting to the `public` schema, but your table might be in another.

```sql
\dn               -- list schemas
SET search_path TO schema_name;
```
3. **Confirm correct database:**

```sql
\c                -- shows current database
```
4. **Verify with a verbose listing:**

```sql
\d+ tablename
```

Still stuck? Run:


```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'tablename';
```


If it returns nothing, the table doesn't exist in that DB under your current search path.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
no i am getting nothing it just goes back to psql prompt
# ChatGPT
Got it‚Äîif `SELECT * FROM tablename;` gives *no error*, just returns to the prompt with no rows, that means:


- The **table exists**
- But it's **empty**

Confirm with:


```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tablename;
```


If that returns `0`, it's confirmed: no data.


You can check when rows were inserted (if tracked), or look at other tables:


```sql
\dt *.*     -- list all tables in all schemas
```


Or check recent writes (if any):


```sql
SELECT relname, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_tup_ins DESC
LIMIT 10;
```


If you're expecting data‚Äîmake sure you're in the right environment (e.g., not your dev container with a fresh DB).
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
well this is a db connection over a kubectl port-forward
# ChatGPT
Ah‚Äîthen suspicion shifts to **environment mismatch or data not persisting**.


Checklist:


1. **Correct Pod/Service?**
Are you port-forwarding to the right Postgres pod or service?

```bash
kubectl get pods -n your-namespace
kubectl port-forward pod/your-postgres-pod 5432:5432 -n your-namespace
```
2. **Check DB volume persistence:**
If the pod was restarted without a persistent volume, data is gone. Look for restarts:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n your-namespace
```
3. **Verify the data source inside the pod:**

```bash
kubectl exec -it pod/your-postgres-pod -n your-namespace -- psql -U postgres -d supertokens
```

Run `SELECT *` from inside the pod. If data is missing there too‚ÄîDB is empty. If data exists inside but not over the forwarded connection, it's probably a **misrouted forward**.
4. **Multiple instances?**
Possible you're looking at a **replica**, or a **sidecar instance** used only for health checks or migrations.
Run:

```bash
SHOW config_file;
```

Check host/IP identity:

```sql
SELECT inet_server_addr(), inet_server_port();
```

Let me know what you find‚Äîcan zero in fast once we confirm the target.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
even from inside the pod, the queries yield precisely nothing
# ChatGPT
Then it's almost certainly this: **the DB was never seeded**, or **its volume is ephemeral** and reset on pod restart.


To confirm:


### 1. **Check uptime/restarts**


```bash
kubectl get pod your-postgres-pod -n your-namespace -o wide
kubectl describe pod your-postgres-pod -n your-namespace | grep -i restart
```


If it's restarted recently and no `PersistentVolumeClaim` is attached, data's gone.



### 2. **Verify PVC binding**


```bash
kubectl get pvc -n your-namespace
```


Look for a bound volume for Postgres. No PVC? It‚Äôs running with emptyDir or no volume‚Äîso data resets every restart.



### 3. **Look at entrypoint/init behavior**


Check if there‚Äôs a `init.sql`, `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, or migration job that *should* seed data:


```bash
kubectl get deployments,statefulsets -n your-namespace
kubectl describe deployment your-postgres-deploy -n your-namespace
```


Also look for Helm values or kustomize overlays that might mount initial SQL.



### Conclusion


No data inside the pod = it's not about psql, it's about **Postgres not having been initialized** or **its data being wiped**.


Want help tracing the PVC or volumeMount setup in your deployment?
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
earlier i was using metabase to connect, it was able to show me the data that was on there, and there was data in the tables, but now even metabase is erroring out
# ChatGPT
That‚Äôs the key detail. Previously Metabase saw real data, now nothing works. That points to **one of three likely causes**:



### üî• 1. **Pod restarted, data wiped (no PVC)**


Postgres was using `emptyDir` or local storage. Restart nuked all data.


**Confirm with:**


```bash
kubectl get pods -n your-namespace -o wide
kubectl describe pod your-postgres-pod -n your-namespace | grep -i restart
kubectl get pvc -n your-namespace
```


No bound PVC? Then yeah, it was ephemeral.



### üåÄ 2. **You're connecting to a new or wrong pod**


Maybe DNS/service changed, or port-forward is targeting a new pod (e.g. after redeploy).


**Check:**


```bash
kubectl get pods -n your-namespace -o wide
kubectl port-forward pod/EXACT-POD-NAME 5432:5432 -n your-namespace
```


Verify with:


```sql
SELECT current_database(), inet_server_addr();
```


Compare with previous values (if you noted them).



### üö´ 3. **Postgres is corrupt or misconfigured**


If Metabase is **erroring out** and `psql` still works but shows **zero rows**, it may not be corruption‚Äîbut it‚Äôs possible Postgres didn‚Äôt boot properly, and the DB is in a weird init state.


**Check logs:**


```bash
kubectl logs pod/your-postgres-pod -n your-namespace
```


Look for errors like:


- `database system was shut down`
- `FATAL:  could not open relation`
- `PANIC:  could not locate`

supertokens-core-5fb5dbf697-h79wl      1/1     Running   0          41h

and the psql port forward works with this command
 kubectl port-forward svc/stg-postgresql -n postgresql  5432:5432
# ChatGPT
That narrows it down‚Äîyou're not port-forwarding to a **pod**, you're port-forwarding to a **service** (`svc/stg-postgresql`) in the **postgresql namespace**. But your pod list shows **no Postgres pod at all**‚Äîand no pods in that namespace.


### ‚ùóProblem: No Postgres pod is currently listed


So what‚Äôs serving `svc/stg-postgresql`? Likely **nothing**‚Äîthe backing pod is gone, and Kubernetes is silently forwarding to nowhere.



### üîç What to do next:


1. **Check the service and what it targets:**

```bash
kubectl get svc stg-postgresql -n postgresql -o yaml
```


Look for `selector:` ‚Äî it tells you what pods it‚Äôs supposed to route to.


1. **List pods in the postgresql namespace:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n postgresql
```


I expect: *nothing running*. That would explain why Metabase errors and psql shows empty or no data‚Äîthere‚Äôs no backing Postgres.


1. **Check if the deployment/statefulset exists:**

```bash
kubectl get deployments,statefulsets -n postgresql
```


If there's no deployment or statefulset for Postgres, then:


- It‚Äôs been **deleted**
- Or it **crashed and never recovered**

1. **Optional sanity check:**
See if any PVCs still exist:

```bash
kubectl get pvc -n postgresql
```


If PVCs exist but no pod is using them, your data *might* be safe and just needs a new pod reattached.



**Bottom line:**
Your service (`stg-postgresql`) has no live backend. You're connecting to a ghost.


Ready to help revive it or inspect its original deployment config.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
- i'm targeting the correct selector
- deployment/statefulset exists
- PVC exists
how do i connect to the actual service instead of a ghost
# ChatGPT
Perfect‚Äîinfra's intact. You're just port-forwarding incorrectly or to the wrong endpoint. Let's connect to the real thing.



### ‚úÖ Step-by-step: Port-forward **to the pod**, not the service


Services are stable, but only work if they *have ready pods*. Safer bet: **forward directly to the pod** behind `stg-postgresql`.


#### 1. **Find the Postgres pod:**


```bash
kubectl get pods -n postgresql -l app=stg-postgresql
```


(Substitute `app=stg-postgresql` with the actual label selector from your service.)


#### 2. **Port-forward directly:**


```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/ -n postgresql 5432:5432
```


#### 3. **Test with psql:**


```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name
```



### ‚úÖ Alternatively: Use the service IP internally


If you're already inside the cluster (e.g. in a debug pod or another service):


```bash
psql -h stg-postgresql.postgresql.svc.cluster.local -U postgres -d your_db_name
```



### üß† Bonus sanity check


Confirm service resolves to pod IPs:


```bash
kubectl get endpoints stg-postgresql -n postgresql
```


If this shows no IPs, service is ghosting again. If it shows one or more IPs: all good‚Äîthen your earlier port-forward may have been racing pod readiness.



Once connected directly, your data should show up as expected. Want help tracing readiness probes or PVC mount paths next?
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
once again there are no resources in the default or postgresql namespace, get pods gives this
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deployment-backend-b49ff867b-dztbq     1/1     Running   0          11h
deployment-frontend-79786dff4f-k2rhf   1/1     Running   0          41h
supertokens-core-5fb5dbf697-h79wl      1/1     Running   0          42h
# ChatGPT
Got it. Now it's crystal clear:



**Your Postgres pod is gone.**
The `stg-postgresql` **service still exists**, but it points to nothing‚Äîhence your ‚Äúghost‚Äù connection.




### üîç Confirm what‚Äôs left:


#### 1. **List all namespaces**


Postgres might have lived in a now-removed namespace.


```bash
kubectl get ns
```


#### 2. **Check for orphaned services:**


```bash
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces | grep stg-postgresql
```


If it still shows up in `postgresql`, but no pods/deployments/PVCs exist in that namespace‚Äîthen the namespace was partially torn down.


#### 3. **Inspect the service selector:**


```bash
kubectl get svc stg-postgresql -n postgresql -o yaml
```


Look for:


```yaml
selector:
  app: postgresql
```


Then:


```bash
kubectl get pods -n postgresql -l app=postgresql
```


You‚Äôll get nothing, confirming: selector is dangling.



### üõ†Ô∏è How to recover


#### Option A: **Re-deploy Postgres**


If you used Helm:


```bash
helm list -n postgresql
helm status  -n postgresql
```


Then redeploy:


```bash
helm upgrade --install  bitnami/postgresql -n postgresql
```


Or if it was deployed manually, check Git or infra-as-code repo for YAML and reapply it.


#### Option B: **Recover PVC data (if persistent)**


Check:


```bash
kubectl get pvc -n postgresql
```


If the PVC still exists, the data's safe. Recreate the Postgres pod and mount that PVC back in under `/bitnami/postgresql` or whatever path your image expects.

# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
i'm pretty sure the postgres is running and data is there as i can see it on the staging website
# ChatGPT
Got it, if the data is **still live on the staging website**, then the Postgres service **is running**, but the issue likely lies with the connection/port-forward setup.


Here‚Äôs the refined plan:


### üîç What we know:


- **Postgres is running** somewhere (on the staging website, at least).
- The **stg-postgresql service** exists.
- There **are no resources** in the `postgresql` namespace when you check with `kubectl get pods`‚Äîthis suggests your Postgres pod might be running **under a different namespace** or **using a non-standard naming convention**.


### üí° Solution: Trace where Postgres really is


#### 1. **Search for the actual Postgres pod across all namespaces**


Run this to list all pods across all namespaces and search for something that looks like a Postgres pod:


```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep postgres
```


Look for the correct pod name here. It‚Äôs likely in a different namespace, or the pod name is different.



#### 2. **Look at the pod‚Äôs labels and selectors**


Once you identify the **correct pod**, confirm it‚Äôs associated with the service by checking the **labels**:


```bash
kubectl get pod  -o yaml -n 
```


Look for the `labels` section‚Äîverify that it matches the selector in the `stg-postgresql` service.


If they match, then `stg-postgresql` should be able to forward traffic to it, and the issue might just be with the **port-forwarding setup**.



#### 3. **Check pod IP and port-forward**


Once you confirm the correct pod and namespace, port-forward directly to that pod:


```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/ -n  5432:5432
```


Then, connect via `psql`:


```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name
```


If everything's working, you‚Äôll be able to see the data!



### üßê Still stuck? Try these checks:


1. **Check the actual service endpoint and target pod(s):**

```bash
kubectl get endpoints stg-postgresql -n 
```


1. **Check logs in your staging container:**
You could get more clues about where the app is actually pointing for the DB.

```bash
kubectl logs  -n 
```



Let me know what you find! I'll help you figure out if the issue is with the service, the port-forward, or the connection string.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep postgres  yields
postgresql        stg-postgresql-0                                                 1/1     Running            0          36h
# ChatGPT
Great, so **stg-postgresql-0** is your Postgres pod, and it‚Äôs running in the `postgresql` namespace. This explains why the service (`stg-postgresql`) was still active, but you weren‚Äôt seeing any pods directly under the `postgresql` namespace with `kubectl get pods -n postgresql`‚Äîthe `stg-postgresql-0` pod is a stateful pod, and it likely has a StatefulSet backing it.


### Solution: Correct the Port-Forwarding


Since you‚Äôve now identified the **exact pod** (`stg-postgresql-0`), you can **directly port-forward to it**.


#### Steps:


1. **Port-forward directly to the Postgres pod** (`stg-postgresql-0`):

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/stg-postgresql-0 -n postgresql 5432:5432
```
2. **Connect with psql:**

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name
```

You should be able to access the Postgres instance and see your data now.



### Bonus: Check if Service is Correct


If you want to double-check that the `stg-postgresql` service is correctly pointing to the `stg-postgresql-0` pod:


```bash
kubectl get svc stg-postgresql -n postgresql -o yaml
```


Ensure the service is targeting the correct pod with the appropriate selectors. If everything looks good, but you're still having issues with Metabase, it might be worth checking the Metabase connection string as well (port-forwarding directly should work, but it might be timing out or misconfigured in the Metabase settings).


Let me know how it goes!
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
great i can now see the data in metabase, but psql queries still give nothing?
# ChatGPT
Nice! It sounds like the connection through Metabase is working, which is a good sign that the database is up and running with the data. However, if **psql** queries still yield nothing, it's likely an issue with the way you're connecting via `psql` or the permissions/configuration of your `psql` session.


### Let's troubleshoot:


#### 1. **Verify the psql Connection**


Double-check the connection string you're using with `psql`. For example:


```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name
```


You can also explicitly set the password if needed:


```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name -W
```


Enter the password when prompted.


#### 2. **Check Database and Schema**


If you're connected but see no data, verify you're using the correct database and schema.


First, list all databases:


```sql
\l
```


Then connect to the correct database:


```sql
\c your_db_name
```


Next, list all tables within the current schema:


```sql
\dt
```


Check which schema you're currently using:


```sql
SHOW search_path;
```


If needed, set the schema manually:


```sql
SET search_path TO schema_name;
```


#### 3. **Check Permissions**


If `psql` is connected to the correct database but still sees no data, it could be a **permissions issue**. Check the current user‚Äôs permissions:


```sql
\du
```


Ensure the `postgres` user (or the user you're connecting as) has sufficient permissions to access the tables.


#### 4. **Check Table Content**


Verify that the tables have data. For example:


```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM your_table;
```


If `COUNT` returns zero, the tables are empty, and the issue lies elsewhere.



### Bonus: Directly Inspect the Logs


If everything seems correct but issues persist, inspect the Postgres logs for any signs of anomalies:


```bash
kubectl logs stg-postgresql-0 -n postgresql
```


Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate connectivity or data loading issues.



Let me know what you find from these steps! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre close to getting everything working.

postgres-#
# ChatGPT
Thanks for pasting that! Based on your history, here‚Äôs what stands out:


- **The COUNT query on MEMBERS returned nothing**‚Äîthis might mean that the table is empty.
- The **search path** query didn't show any results, which means it wasn't run‚Äîperhaps it was omitted by accident.
- The **postgres role has superuser privileges**, so there's no issue with permissions.

Let's dig deeper.



### 1. **Check if the MEMBERS table has data**


Run this to check if the table **truly has data**:


```sql
SELECT * FROM MEMBERS LIMIT 10;
```


This will return the first 10 rows. If you get no rows, the table is empty.



### 2. **Check the current schema and search path**


You need to ensure you're in the right schema. Run:


```sql
SHOW search_path;
```


This will show the schema you're currently in. If it's empty or not the correct one, set it explicitly:


```sql
SET search_path TO public;
```


After that, run:


```sql
SELECT * FROM MEMBERS LIMIT 10;
```


This will verify whether the data exists in the `public` schema or another one.



### 3. **Check if there are other schemas or tables**


List all schemas:


```sql
\dn
```


Then, list all tables in all schemas:


```sql
\dt *.*
```


This will ensure you're seeing everything, even if the table was created in a non-default schema.



### 4. **Check if data exists in other tables**


If `MEMBERS` is empty, check other tables for data:


```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM another_table_name;
```


This will confirm if the issue is specific to one table or applies to others as well.



Once you've tried these, let me know what results you get, and we‚Äôll take it from there.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò

Thanks for confirming. Since you can see data in **Metabase** but **psql** still shows no results, the issue likely lies in one of these areas:


### üîë 1. **Search Path/Schema Issue**


It‚Äôs possible that **Metabase** is using a different schema than `psql`, which is why you're seeing the data in Metabase but not in `psql`.


#### **Check and set the correct schema in psql**:


Run:


```sql
SHOW search_path;
```


This will show the schemas that are currently in use. If the correct schema (where `MEMBERS` resides) isn't in the search path, you'll need to set it.


To set the schema to `public` (or whatever the correct one is):


```sql
SET search_path TO public;
```


Then, try:


```sql
SELECT * FROM MEMBERS LIMIT 10;
```



### üîë 2. **Check for Case Sensitivity**


PostgreSQL is **case-sensitive** by default. If your table name or column names have uppercase letters (e.g., `MEMBERS`), you‚Äôll need to quote them in SQL queries.


Try this in `psql`:


```sql
SELECT * FROM "MEMBERS" LIMIT 10;
```


This will handle the case sensitivity issue if the table was created with uppercase letters in its name.



### üîë 3. **Inspect psql Client Version**


It could be a version mismatch issue where **psql** is not fully compatible with your Postgres version or there's some misconfiguration. To check the version of `psql`:


```bash
psql --version
```


Then verify the Postgres version running in your pod:


```bash
kubectl exec -it stg-postgresql-0 -n postgresql -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```


Check if there's any notable discrepancy in version compatibility.



### üîë 4. **Verify Data in the Right Database**


Make sure you're in the **correct database**. If you‚Äôre connected to a different database than expected, it could cause this issue.


Run:


```sql
SELECT current_database();
```


This will tell you which database you're connected to. If you're not in the correct one, switch databases:


```sql
\c your_db_name
```



### üîë 5. **Metabase vs. psql Connection Differences**


Check if Metabase is using a **different user** or connection string. If Metabase is connected with a different user or has additional configuration that gives it access to certain data, you might not have the same privileges in `psql`.


Run this to check the user in `psql`:


```sql
SELECT current_user;
```


Then, compare it with the user Metabase is using for the connection. If they differ, the issue could be related to user privileges.



### **Next Steps:**


- **Set the schema correctly**: Make sure you're using the right schema in `psql`.
- **Verify case sensitivity**: Quote the table name if it has uppercase letters.
- **Check the user/connection**: Compare the user you're using in `psql` with the one in Metabase.

Let me know if any of these steps reveal new information!
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
it does warn on start
WARNING: psql major version 14, server major version 15.
         Some psql features might not work.
# ChatGPT
Ah, **version mismatch**‚Äîthat could be the root cause. PostgreSQL **major version 14** (`psql`) doesn't necessarily work perfectly with a **major version 15** server.


### üîë Why this matters:


Some features, behavior, or optimizations might differ between major versions, and that could explain why you're seeing data in **Metabase** (which might be using a more compatible version of `psql`) but **not in your current psql session**.



### **What to do next:**


1. **Check the available database versions:**
It might be helpful to ensure that you're using the exact version of `psql` that matches your Postgres server (version 15). Let‚Äôs verify the server version again from inside the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it stg-postgresql-0 -n postgresql -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```

This confirms that the server is indeed running version 15, which matches the warning.
2. **Upgrade psql (if necessary):**
To match version 15 on your client side, you can upgrade your `psql` client to **PostgreSQL 15** on your local machine.

- **For macOS (Homebrew)**:

```bash
brew upgrade postgresql
```
- **For Ubuntu/Debian**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client-15
```
After upgrading, reconnect using the new version:

```bash
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name
```

Or you can explicitly reference the new version if you have multiple versions installed:

```bash
/usr/pgsql-15/bin/psql -h localhost -U postgres -d your_db_name
```
3. **Try a direct connection in the pod (debugging)**:
If upgrading `psql` is not an option or you'd like to test quickly, you can also directly run `psql` from within the pod to avoid the local client mismatch:

```bash
kubectl exec -it stg-postgresql-0 -n postgresql -- psql -U postgres -d your_db_name
```

This bypasses the local `psql` client and ensures compatibility with the Postgres server version running in the pod.
4. **Check if the warning can be ignored**:
Sometimes, the warning doesn‚Äôt stop functionality. If upgrading isn't an option, you can **ignore the warning** for now and focus on schema, data, or privileges, but **if features break**, upgrading is the cleaner solution.


### **Let me know how it goes**:


- If the **upgrade to version 15** resolves the issue.
- Or if using the `psql` inside the pod directly works.

Either way, we should be able to get the data visible in `psql` again.

even with the latest version my queries yield nothing
# ChatGPT
Given that you're still seeing nothing in `psql` even after addressing the version mismatch, here are some additional things to investigate.


### üîç Let's run through a few more checks:



### 1. **Verify Database Connection Again**


Let's first ensure you're connected to the correct database and using the right schema.


1. **Check the current database:**

```sql
SELECT current_database();
```

If you‚Äôre not connected to the correct one, run:

```sql
\c your_db_name
```
2. **Check the schema and tables:**
Ensure you're querying the right schema. Run:

```sql
SHOW search_path;
```

If it's not pointing to the correct schema, set it explicitly:

```sql
SET search_path TO public;
```

Then, list the tables:

```sql
\dt
```

Ensure the table you're trying to query (`MEMBERS`) is listed here. If not, check if there‚Äôs any other schema by running:

```sql
\dn
```


### 2. **Case Sensitivity in Table and Column Names**


PostgreSQL treats unquoted table and column names as lowercase. If your `MEMBERS` table was created with mixed or uppercase letters, you‚Äôll need to quote the name.


Try querying with quotes around the table name:


```sql
SELECT * FROM "MEMBERS" LIMIT 10;
```



### 3. **Check for Data Visibility Issues**


It‚Äôs possible that data is being hidden due to **Row-Level Security (RLS)** or similar configurations.


1. **Check if RLS is enabled:**
Run the following query to check if RLS is enabled on the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_privileges WHERE table_name = 'MEMBERS';
```

If Row-Level Security is enabled, check the policies applied to the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'MEMBERS';
```

If RLS is configured, it might be filtering out data based on the user or session.


### 4. **Inspect Data in Metabase vs psql**


Since Metabase is able to see the data, let‚Äôs investigate how it‚Äôs connecting. It might be using **a different user**, **schema**, or **filtering mechanism** that allows it to view the data when `psql` cannot.


1. **Check user**: What user is Metabase using to connect? Ensure the user you're connected to in `psql` has the same permissions and access.
Run this to check your `psql` user:

```sql
SELECT current_user;
```

Compare that with the user in Metabase‚Äôs connection settings.
2. **Check table visibility from Metabase**: In Metabase, ensure that it's not applying any filters or permissions that might hide certain data.


### 5. **Check Logs for Anomalies**


Check Postgres logs for any errors or warning messages that might provide clues. You can do this by viewing the logs from inside the pod:


```bash
kubectl logs stg-postgresql-0 -n postgresql
```


Look for any unusual entries that might indicate connectivity or permission issues.



### Conclusion


At this point, here are the most likely causes:


- **Schema mismatch**: Double-check the schema you're querying.
- **Case sensitivity**: Ensure table/column names match in case.
- **RLS or permissions issue**: Make sure there are no filters hiding the data in `psql`.

Try these steps and let me know what you find! If it‚Äôs still not working, we‚Äôll dive deeper into the logs or configuration.

Ah, classic! üòÑ That‚Äôll do it every time. Not ending a query with a semicolon can cause it to silently wait for more input, so it might seem like it‚Äôs not returning anything.


Now that it's working, is there anything else you need help with, or are you good to go?
