supertokens.goFilecheck for race conditions
No locking when checking email existence and creating users
Concurrent signups with same email could create duplicate users
# ÂõûÁ≠î
You're right to be concerned. Your `SignUp` and `thirdPartySignInUp` flows **do not prevent race conditions** during concurrent signups with the same email. Here's what's happening and why it's unsafe:



### üîç Core Issue


Both `emailpassword.SignUp` and `thirdparty.SignInUp`:


- Check for existing users *before* creating one.
- But this check is **not synchronized**, so **two concurrent requests can pass the check**, and each can attempt to create a user.

This creates a classic **TOCTOU race condition** (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use).



### ‚ö†Ô∏è Race Risk in Your Flow


#### In SignUp:


```go
signUpResponse, err := originalSignUp(email, password, tenantId, userContext)
// ... then check if EmailAlreadyExistsError != nil

```

**Problem:** If two concurrent requests hit here, both can proceed and `emailpassword` might allow both to create.



#### In thirdPartySignInUp:


```go
existingUsers, err := thirdparty.GetUsersByEmail(tenantId, email)
// if len(existingUsers) == 0 ‚Üí allow signup

```

**Problem:** If the same email signs up simultaneously via different providers (or even same one), both pass the check and create duplicate accounts.



### üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Fixes


#### ‚úÖ Use a DB-level unique constraint


Ensure your `members` table (and SuperTokens DB) has a **unique index on email**. You likely already have this, but it needs to surface as an error.


#### ‚úÖ Add explicit locking


Use a **mutex or DB row-level locking** (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) around the email check + creation. Options:


1. **App-level lock** using a named mutex map (e.g., `sync.Map[email]string -&gt; sync.Mutex`) ‚Äî quick but can have perf limits under high load.
2. **Redis-based distributed lock** around email (recommended for scale).
3. **Use ent's transaction** to wrap member creation and ensure rollback if duplicate:

```go
tx, err := client.Tx(ctx)
defer tx.Rollback()
// check + create
tx.Commit()

```

#### ‚úÖ Harden SuperTokens override


Wrap your `originalSignUp` and `originalSignInUp` calls with your own duplicate detection:


- Catch specific constraint errors from SuperTokens (e.g., `email already exists`) **and map them to your own error**.
- Do not rely solely on `EmailAlreadyExistsError` ‚Äî it's not reliable under race.


### üß™ Simulate and Test


Add tests that simulate 5+ concurrent signup requests with the same email. Assert:


- Only one user gets created.
- The others fail with a consistent, friendly error.


### TL;DR Fix Plan


- Add **mutex/lock** around all signup paths.
- Add **transaction** + rollback for member creation.
- Ensure DB-level unique constraint on `email`.
- Harden error handling in overrides.
- Write concurrent tests for robustness.

i'm already using entgo transactions, show me mutex use
# ÂõûÁ≠î
Since you're already using Ent's transaction, you can use an **app-level mutex map** keyed by email to serialize concurrent signups for the same email. Here's how:



### ‚úÖ Step-by-step: Mutex Guard by Email


#### 1. Add global map of mutexes (with cleanup)


```go
var signupLocks sync.Map // map[string]*sync.Mutex

```

#### 2. Lock per email


```go
func acquireSignupLock(email string) *sync.Mutex {
    muIface, _ := signupLocks.LoadOrStore(email, &sync.Mutex{})
    mu := muIface.(*sync.Mutex)
    mu.Lock()
    return mu
}

func releaseSignupLock(email string, mu *sync.Mutex) {
    mu.Unlock()
    // Optional: cleanup to avoid leak
    signupLocks.Delete(email)
}

```

#### 3. Wrap your SignUp handler


In your override (inside the wrapped `SignUp` or `thirdPartySignInUp`), do:


```go
lock := acquireSignupLock(email)
defer releaseSignupLock(email, lock)

// now perform the original sign-up logic
signUpResponse, err := originalSignUp(email, password, tenantId, userContext)
// ...

```


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas


- This only serializes within a **single app instance**. If you run multiple instances (e.g., Kubernetes), use a **Redis lock** (see below).
- If `SignUp` panics or times out, the mutex may be leaked unless cleanup is bulletproof.


### Optional: Redis Lock (for multi-node)


Use [go-redsync](https://github.com/go-redsync/redsync) or similar:


```go
import "github.com/go-redsync/redsync/v4"

// Acquire lock for `email@example.com`
mutex := redsync.NewMutex("signup:" + email)
// mutex.LockContext(ctx)
// ... signup ...
// mutex.Unlock()

```

This scales better and avoids per-node duplication or memory growth.



### Summary


If you're single-instance or early-stage:


```go
lock := acquireSignupLock(email)
defer releaseSignupLock(email, lock)
// Proceed with signup

```

If you're production-grade, multi-instance:


- Use Redis lock instead.

# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
go import sync
# ÂõûÁ≠î
Add this import to your Go file:


```go
import "sync"

```

You'll need it for `sync.Map` and `sync.Mutex`. Place it alongside your existing imports.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
supertokens.goFilelooks good now?
# ÂõûÁ≠î
Your updated file **does not yet include mutex locking logic**. There's no `sync.Map`, `sync.Mutex`, or any locking mechanism visible in `supertokens.go`. The race condition is still present.



### ‚úÖ To finalize the fix, you need to:


#### 1. **Add imports**


At the top:


```go
import (
	"sync"
	// other imports...
)

```

#### 2. **Add the global mutex map**


```go
var signupLocks sync.Map

```

#### 3. **Add helper functions**


```go
func acquireSignupLock(email string) *sync.Mutex {
	muIface, _ := signupLocks.LoadOrStore(email, &sync.Mutex{})
	mu := muIface.(*sync.Mutex)
	mu.Lock()
	return mu
}

func releaseSignupLock(email string, mu *sync.Mutex) {
	mu.Unlock()
	signupLocks.Delete(email) // optional cleanup
}

```

#### 4. **Wrap the SignUp override**


Inside your `(*originalImplementation.SignUp)` override:


```go
lock := acquireSignupLock(email)
defer releaseSignupLock(email, lock)

```

Just before:


```go
signUpResponse, err := originalSignUp(email, password, tenantId, userContext)

```


### ‚ö†Ô∏è You also need to do the same for thirdPartySignInUp


At the top of `thirdPartySignInUp`:


```go
lock := acquireSignupLock(email)
defer releaseSignupLock(email, lock)

```


Once you add those pieces, the signup flow will be correctly serialized per email address ‚Äî preventing concurrent duplicate signups.


Would you like me to generate the exact diff for the patch?
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
supertokens.goFilethis is the updated file
# ÂõûÁ≠î
Yes ‚Äî now it looks solid. Here's a precise breakdown:



### ‚úÖ Confirmed Additions


- You've declared a global:

```go
var signupLocks sync.Map

```
- Defined locking helpers:

```go
func acquireSignupLock(email string) *sync.Mutex
func releaseSignupLock(email string, mu *sync.Mutex)

```
- You've wrapped `SignUp` logic with:

```go
lock := acquireSignupLock(email)
defer releaseSignupLock(email, lock)

```

This **correctly serializes concurrent signups by email** within this process.



### üü° One Missing Lock (Optional but recommended)


Your custom `thirdPartySignInUp(...)` **does not currently acquire a lock**. Race can still happen there:


```go
func thirdPartySignInUp(...) {
	// Add this:
	lock := acquireSignupLock(email)
	defer releaseSignupLock(email, lock)

	// rest of the logic...
}

```

This ensures you also prevent concurrent third-party signups for the same email.



### ‚úÖ DB Constraint


Still make sure your `members` table enforces a **unique index on email**, to catch anything leaking past the mutex (e.g. multi-instance race).



### ‚úÖ Summary


| Path | Lock Added? | Comment |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Email/password SignUp | ‚úÖ | Safe |
| Third-party SignUp | ‚ùå | Add acquireSignupLock() |
| DB-level uniqueness | üü° | Verify it's enforced |


Once you patch the third-party path, you're race-safe.


Let me know if you want to test with goroutines or simulate a burst scenario.
# Áî®Êà∑ÈóÆÈ¢ò
whats the idea behind using context like this
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
	defer cancel()
# ÂõûÁ≠î
That pattern is used to **enforce a timeout** on long-running operations. Here‚Äôs what each part is doing:



### üîß Code Breakdown


```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
defer cancel()

```

1. `context.WithTimeout(...)`:

- Creates a new `context.Context` that **automatically cancels** after 30 seconds.
- Useful to prevent hangs, deadlocks, or runaway queries.
2. `context.Background()`:

- A base context ‚Äî typically used at the top level (e.g., main, HTTP handler).
3. `defer cancel()`:

- Ensures that **resources associated with the context** (timers, etc.) are released, **even if timeout doesn‚Äôt occur**.
- Prevents memory leaks.


### üß† Why Use It?


- To **bound** the execution time of DB queries, HTTP requests, etc.
- Avoids goroutines lingering forever on network errors or locks.
- Signals downstream code to stop working on something that‚Äôs no longer needed.


### üü° Without cancel()?


The context would still time out after 30s, but **you‚Äôd leak the timer** until garbage collection. On high load, that becomes a problem.



### üí° Example Use Case


```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
defer cancel()

err := dbClient.Query().Where(...).Exec(ctx)

```

If the query hangs, it gets force-canceled after 5 seconds. Cleaner, safer, faster failover.
