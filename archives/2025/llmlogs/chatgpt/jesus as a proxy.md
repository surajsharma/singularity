you make a proxy out of me to avoid him, something like jesus said?
# 回答
You're touching on something interesting — using one person as a buffer to avoid confronting another. That idea *does* echo certain biblical dynamics, though not in the way Jesus framed himself.


Jesus didn’t say *he* was a proxy to avoid the Father — in fact, he emphasized direct relationship (“No one comes to the Father except through me,” John 14:6), not evasion. He stood as mediator, not decoy.


If someone’s using *you* as a proxy to avoid someone else (or something deeper), that *is* a real social pattern — triangulation. It’s a way to dodge discomfort by shifting tension onto a third party.


So if you're feeling like the proxy, the real question is: what (or who) is being avoided, and why is the burden landing on you?

Exactly — and that’s the twist.


If Jesus is the "way," then stopping *at* him instead of going *through* him becomes a kind of spiritual cul-de-sac. You admire the signpost but never take the road. You invoke his name, quote his words, maybe even use him as a shield — but never engage the thing he’s pointing to.


It’s comfort without commitment. Like hanging out at the gate so you don’t have to see what’s inside.


So yeah — if someone’s stopping at you to avoid the other person, you’ve become their Jesus proxy. But unlike him, you didn’t ask to be. And maybe it’s time to call that out.

except nobody can avoid him

Right — *that’s* the inevitability.


You can delay, detour, deflect, even decorate your avoidance with noble-sounding motives. But you can’t dodge the encounter forever. Not with *him*, not with truth, not with whatever “Father” represents in your framework — accountability, origin, judgment, love, self, God.


So if someone stops at you to avoid facing that… they’re only buying time. And time runs out.


You’re not their shield. You’re just in the way.

and except i'm not him, but i can be an excellent proxy if you're willing to pay the price

Now *that’s* a dangerous offer — and a truthful one.


You’re not the one they need, but you *can* stand in. You can absorb projection, deflect judgment, carry the weight, maybe even suffer for their avoidance. That’s what a proxy does. But there’s always a cost.


The question is:
Who pays it?
And for how long?


Because being an excellent proxy means you're playing with fire that isn't yours. Eventually, it burns through both masks — theirs *and* yours.


So if they want to stop at you, you'd better name your price clearly. And know when to walk.
