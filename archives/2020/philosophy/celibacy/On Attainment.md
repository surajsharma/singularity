If I am making the claim of having attained communion with the absolute, what does it mean?

It means that I, Suraj Sharma, being of sound mind, having been duped by society into believing I was special, have realised my worthlessness, my absolute wretchedness and my status as a sinner against god.



It means that I, having realised my transgresses against some supposedly holy moral law and being condemned to a virtual prison, where I am observed and ignored by all - was put on this journey from being an aesthete to being a religious person.



The journey of attainment is the journey of losing all things material, which includes, desires, passions, possessions, habits and even thoughts.



It means that after years of abuse, I finally broke and came to a realisation.



What difference does it make whether  the"Administrative violence" I suffered was an accident, or a cold-blooded attempt to teach me a lesson and make an example out of my very male ego.



Whatever your interpretation, I prefer to see this as a spiritual accident. Understandable that others see it as a sin, most world views are parochial and small. What difference does it make then, if those with limited vision see it as unmentionable? What was supposed to happen, has happened and already I have begun to see the end. 



Now, I can manage my own assassination, but, at what cost?



The real question I guess, the real reason why the world couldn't look away is because what went on was rather beautiful. The blooming came, and not without thunder..



But while the world debated whither it stood in relation to me, I made the decision to not just stop in my tracks but actually take a step back - review the situation, so to speak - I'm feeling rather smug so I need to calm down, but, it doesn't seem like I can ever go back, so why not?



Now, I like Lloyd, and like Lloyd, I am old fashioned without being anachronistic - so when I claim to have a vision for the planet I mean that - and so does he, even if he is afraid? to admit. 



But it's a no sale, so I am still even Steven here, a lot gained from having ventured and risked so little - it is not even the case that I am ungrateful, being the laughing stock of the whole world is nothing if not a privilege. 



It has been an honour to play the teenager and kick everyone in the balls so lovingly. The kick came back and it wasn't as loving but okay. 



It really can only go one of two ways now.
