# locus of certainty 
is the focus of death, to put it more simply, certainty lies at the very heart of death

in other words, certainty is the essence of death, and esse est perciipi



without urgency, the focus remains unsteady,

pace yourself because change is inevitable

instead of locating meaning in real time, find it in history

"what was the artist/creator thinking when he made this”

rather than

"what are they trying to tell me”

not everything that looks like a transgression
is a transgression, some are mere explorations

uprooting the stump


report cards



me: still at 80% and hopefully alright with the world, definitely self-satisfied and not wanting any problems, nor success at this point, or in this manner. unclear about what has happened, confused about what I want. extremely clear on what i don't want. brave enough to stay away from any situation i don't fully understand.

intelligent enough to realize things are not quite as they are presented, though what is revealed may not be far off from the actuality.

integrated enough to hold myself in check, no matter the cost

decisive about my opinion on parts of the story i know to be true beyond a reasonable doubt

indifferent enough to let it all go as a good idea for a sci-fiction novella

mental health vs spirituality
mental health is proving your sanity to others

spirituality is proving your sanity to yourself

religion "is" a vector that points inward

there is a gradient and then shūnya

this is the first level

to abrupt endings

to open secrets 

to new cults

Activity-dependent plasticity can have significant implications for healthy development, learning, memory, and recovery from brain damage. [12] [13] [14]

your happiness is paramount
why get involved with people who have already demonstrated themselves to be deceitful, arrogant, stupid, incompetent, lusty, uncaring and selfish?

your own happiness is paramount, success and riches are worthless and indeed dangerous if they come at the cost of peace.



The essence of greatness is the perception that virtue is enough. Poverty is its ornament. It does not need plenty, and can very well abide its loss - Emerson

the thing about ego
it never tells the same story twice

for your entertainment, you pay a heavy price

a benevolent enemy who doesn't know any better and merely wishes to offset 

what it perceives as hostile, namely time



so in rising above entertainment/narrative, you get the see time

the reason
the reason it must be my own, albeit nudged from online feedback decision to change and welcome this

is that tomorrow if things fuck up, or i fuck up, the blame falls entirely on me - no one held a gun to my head, not literally anyway,

and as much certainty as i may bring to this, the fog of war sticks around



so i move, but move slowly, and indeed under better supervision, perhaps even slower

because i move based solely on long term vision, short term visibility is -1 trillion % 
of course i'm exaggerating

## the rules matter
https://timroughgarden.org/f13/f13.html

The point is that, in systems with strategic participants,the rules matter.Poorly designed systems suffer from unexpected and undesirable results. The burden lies on the system designer to anticipate strategic behavior, not on the participants to behave against their own interests. Can we blame the badminton players for acting to maximize their medal placement? To quote Hartline and Kleinberg [5]:

”The next time we bemoan people exploiting loopholes to subvert the intent of the rule makers, instead of asking ’What’s wrong with these people?” let’s instead ask,’What’s wrong with the rules?’ and then adopt a scientifically principled approach to fixing them.”


## mechanism design

There is a well-developed science of rule-making, the field of mechanism design.The goal in this field is to design rules so that strategic behavior by participants leads to a desirable outcome. Killer applications of mechanism design, which we will discuss in detail later,include Internet search auctions, wireless spectrum auctions, matching medical residents to hospitals, matching children to schools, and kidney exchange markets.


# why i'm ok with this #singularity

any new consciousness can only have a single point of origin, what if earth is that point for humanity?

*self consciousness and/or language with self-ref

## genius vs enlightenment

established to genius may be a big step,

but genius to enlightenment is a very small one, it is so small that you can reach there only through a shortcut in time

like a wormhole.

## why our god is a jealous god

because nobody knows how to talk to him one on one,

communal prayers and gatherings have their value

but prayer is ultimately as personal as it gets

and should someone overhear a prayer, even if by "unlawful" means

how can it be a bad thing?



they know how to to talk to every other god and deity

but nobody knows how to tackle Jesus

i don't claim to know what to say

but i'm sure as shit gonna tickle him silly if 

i ever saw him, now that i have a feather and all :P

i'm not heartless, just traumatised, and frankly the constant barrage of absentee communication is

washing my brain in quite the opposite direction, you can't say i didn't warn y'all

so idk where it might lead us, please accept my deepest sympathies for the situation you have managed to 

put yourself in for my sake, there can be no end to my sorrow it seems.
