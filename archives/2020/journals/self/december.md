## celibate life / narrative hygiene 

- At the age of 34, having made love to both men and women, having enjoyed almost all categories of material pleasures and having lost all interest in worldly affairs – finding them trite and overrated, I started my spiritual journey and was soon rewarded with a growing indifference towards the body.

- A lame conspiracy whereby my thoughts were being read via satellite and I was isolated from the world aided my decision and direction.

- It felt amazing to be the center of such attention while being in constant communication with the spirit within me, which prodded - and in no uncertain terms - me to retire, so I started planning the retreat.

- By this time I had already heard Osho's commentary on the Dhammapada, and had witnessed, along with the whole world, what I can only describe as supernatural events – supporting my decision to retreat within.

- The idea of monkhood wasn't new, though it only strengthened with the passage of time and the psychological terror of being watched/fear of losing sovereignty to big brother.

`Though the experiment itself was successful, the world perhaps wasn't ready for this kind of unification and perhaps won't be ready for another couple hundred years. I took the public humiliation in stride but the idea was too controversial and I felt ostracized and unwelcome in society for having suggested it, however tacitly.`

- I did not wish to be a bother to people anymore, so decided to slowly, carefully detach myself from the rat race and embrace buddhism as a humble monk, living the rest of my days in peace, not breathing a word about the bs to anyone. It was a matter of logistics and mental preparation.

## The goal is to Be A Monk before my 38th birthday. After paying all monetary debts.

> Only death could separate me from this decision.

## Premeditatio Malorum

> “What is quite unlooked for is more crushing in its effect, and unexpectedness adds to the weight of a disaster. This is a reason for ensuring that nothing ever takes us by surprise. We should project our thoughts ahead of us at every turn and have in mind every possible eventuality instead of only the usual course of events… `Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck. All the terms of our human lot should be before our eye`.” — Seneca #stoicism


## The book's title appears halfway...

through the novel: "If one knew, he wondered, the facts, would one have to feel pity even for the planets? If one reached what they called the heart of the matter?"
