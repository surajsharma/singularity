play dead, that's one strategy

play dumb, that's the other


the other is of course, don't play dead and keep trying to push the envelope

whatever you do, do not try to placate or win favors, stick to your guns

"smile, be gay"

pissing the system off, in the words of the poet Bukowski leads to some, but not all of the following:

losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. 
not eating for three or four days.
freezing on a park bench. 
jail. 
derision
mockery--isolation. 

in my case it was some of these things:
mild unemployment
mild racism
mild food poisoning
psychic warfare
ending up in a cult/underworld



nevertheless, i persisted.



one thing about being in a global cult and having pissed the system off thoroughly is that your employment status becomes precarious.

most people give up here, play the victim card and check themselves out, becoming various sorts of bums used to getting kicked around.

the first idea is to not let your employment status or socio-economic prospects faze you, recognize that you have pissed the system off, and understand that it is a dangerous thing to do in any universe.

if you're not dead immediately, you will at least be ostracized, it will feel like being put in a purgatory, you will push through.

if you survive, your only reward will be the unpleasant confessions of people who will continue to try to kill you (by osctracism, if nothing else) while pleading for you to be their savior, this is just their narcissism, don't bite.

if you survive for long after thoroughly pissing the system off, the system will try to fuse with you, this will hurt a lot, not in the least because it is a dilemma, if you merge with the system, you lose your identity, if you hold out, you don't do much better. the system willn play with your, in the words of Ye, “rent, food, water, and lights”, but also your internet connection, obviously. bear witness.

in so far as the system is nothing but a mob, it's job is to leave you alone in direct proportion to how disgusted it is with you, understand that it will do everything in its power to leave you suicidal, if you are willing to put yourself out, the system will have won, you will get praised for a while and the “people under the microscope” will have moved on, without any fundamental change to their constitution.

think chester bennington, don't fall for the oldest trick in the book.

if you piss the system off in full public view, and refuse to merge with it, this will lead to identity politics. you will need to be above all that in order to survive.

remember that pissing the system thoroughly off is the only act of political freedom, and as such, greater than any politics. if it wasn't above politics, politics wouldn't envvy it, and the pisser-offer (hereafter known as the “party”) would get along. however, that's not the idea. to get along with humanity that has led the planet in a square ditch is no measure of being human.

pissing the system off is an act of defiance and an invitation to death. style matters. once the death threats start, you can start to consider yourself a winner, regardless of whether the system means them or not.

if none of this deters you, time is the last weapon in a defeated, pissed off system's arsenal - it will delay the inevitable any way it can.

however, the passage of time should be a bother to only the uninitiated. to suffer in this way is to be a friend to the system, without placating or pandering. time is a weapon because time is death. 

but that's not all, the system will then test you with meanness, roughness, emotional unavailability… … in so many words, routine.

so time, and routine… once it gets there you are looking at the truth right in the eye…

the system seems to be confessing it has become a machine, an almost mechanical carrier of evoltion derserving of precious little by way of imitation…the system is nothing to aspire to, even if, and especially if it keeps you comfortable, life is to be lived outside one's comfort zone, but not too much

do recognize that only a few are able to piss the system off so thoroughly and live to tell tale.

and while your at it, let it be your only revenge, telling the tale for the system plays with your soul and can leave it charged and weponised for self-harm or incite violence - seek no salvation outside - the system has no sovereignty on the world within.

but on the outside, it's time, routine, and if you're real lucky a screen to play with and fill with boxes and triangles.

if you have found salvation inside, you will find salvation outside, even without any spirituality or religion

a system startled and paranoid will try to threaten it's members, COVID -19 is such a symptom of this preemptive-strike to keep the masses in check, for a fearless bunch will quickly become ungovernable. 

the key isn't being the change you wish to see, but to find out what to wish, and there are momentums

members of the system will poison you and think they're someone for doing it, not knowing that had it not been them poisoning you, it would have been someone else

if the system finds that you are unafraid of death, it will try and scare you with life for it is that irrational

in advanced democracies, the system is not a coherent singularity but a split, it is duality, no wonder to an advait individual a dual system will seem repugnant and abhorrent, an individual is nondual

i pissed the system by sucking more from the screen than it was worth, in the process finding the next chapter of my sexuality and living this epic life

i recognized that i had pissed the system so bad that if they decided to institutionalize me i would not have resisted

i recognized that i had pissed the system so bad that i could only apologize but my apologies were no good
