## Problem Statement: Configurable, exportable, persistent, tab groups in a FSM.
## Philosophy: One thing well - enhance the chrome tabbing experience by 10x
## Approach: Started with react based boilerplate 

## Features (scope creep!)
### tab features
    - levitating active icon
    - inactive tab desaturation  spp
    - dnd in window
    - dnd across win/grp
    - some sort of super fast 3d rotation on cursor/hover 
### group features
    - auto group based on rule/regex
    - auto group on domain
    - window/group merge with dnd
    - ðŸ“… timed, self-destructing tabs/pages/groups
    - ðŸ“… timed, recurring tabs/groups
    - launch group on startup  
### commands
    kill (with animation)
        all
        tab
        windows
        group
        search

    curd
        tab
        window
        group
        page

    sequences:
        search andâ€¦ split, destroy, group/name
        new [tab/window/group/page] andâ€¦
        group [search results, all current, â€¦ ] and â€¦
        ungroup [group] and .. 
### options

    tab to flip to options modal
    now playing (Spotify, youtube, soundcloud â€¦)
    day theme / match system setting
    password protect on launch, locally persistent hashed password
    custom launch shortcut
    party mode: 8-bit animation loop plays as bg
    holiday mode: snow, real snow
    clear search on exit meta
    analytics page
    save (.chor config, pages json) and export all saved
    sync saved to google drive

# state
- state should be a kind of bubbling up, not a reactive stream but a more modular cascade.
- all events be directed to the FSM
- render only on state update
