- kaliyug has looped on itself, what a time to be alive!

- i'm going to bury capitalism deeper, for cheaper

- they fed me shit and this eventually led to asexual, abiological modes of reproduction, some sort of psychosomatic virgin births

- 2023: the year of radical focus

- aren't ya'll lucky my middle name is d not r

`shayad in logo ke liye koi jaadu tona tha ya ho gya, westerners are always looking to find magic in india and they often do

- right there, smack in the middle of the strange, the bizzare, and the uncanny and surreal! and yet, it was hardly weird or surprising, ancient businness as usual on an ancient planet

- i wouldn't be able to achieve what i did without somone shoving the whole 9 inches of L up my ass

- nazar teri buri burka main pehnu?

- on kashmir: today there are more, better ways to interfere with fully capable democracies than over territorial issues and identities, i offer my subjectivity as a theater of infinite war and infinte corruption, and i'm able to do this without selling my soul - what's to fear? but still, i insist on "if it ain't broken don't fix it" as a credo.

- on relationships: i discovered i owed 3 kinds of loyalty to 3 kinds of people, one was personal kind i owed to republicans, which implied fighting in public but loving in personal affairs, the other, the inversion of this loyalty was a very public one, which implied loving in public but fighting in private, how utterly fucked i was, and this was completely a mechanical reaction of sorts, i didn't exactly set out to find people to owe my life to. it wasn't the case that anything was for "pretend" here, just as things stood. then there were those i owe a nonexistent kind of loyalty to, these ppl were largely mediators of sort but brokering a peaceful solution was hardly their headache, unless they got something out of it, which made them dangerous because in the event of any untoward happenning they lacked the kind of cover rich ppl had. the way greed works if you are hypnotized first by the lure of the golden deer, my advice to these ppl was still to not chase a mirage. of course, i am not aware of half of the story, so it may be the case that i owed them in a 33-33-33% ratio structure, or some other distribution. this is if i'm keeping emotions aside, with emotions, the story was different, then, instead of a distribution there is an absolute hierarchy.


- what is a brahmin if not someone who puts the other to work for his own gain? a brahmin is like a constantine who excels in taking his demons to disneyland and then leaving them there

- as i continued waking up, the ptsd started to melt into what i could only describe as love, AND HOW!

- the way "dependent origination" works is, revealed knowledge leads to more revealed knowledge

- revealed knowledge can only be tested, not talked about

- these people wanted my dad, not knowing who he truly was, not knowing, his were the wrong set of tear ducts to activate

- liliputians study me as if they can understand by sex or studying alone

- sometimes i really wonder if they spent all this money just to teach me a lesson or if they really wanted to eat shit behind curtains

- to the corrupt indian IAS lobby pulling liliputian strings i have both middle fingers up and i say "saki thodi aur pila ki kuch nasha utre"

- IAS has become synonymous with corruption, hence the fake attempts and foreplay with power, and not the good kind of corrption either,  the insidious, institutional kind that can turn a hindu into a muslim, and a secular country to a muslim country real quick.. making independence a relatively short tryst with destiny. the aap/kejriwal moat/stronghold against it was fast becoming a last man standing personality cult, despite experiments with fresh #leadership.. curious to see if the bathwater ends up with the baby

- i have reasons to believe my family had relations with the americans since at least the time of independence

- the "committee for the liberation of iran" shall have to taste defeat after defeat until it dissolves in my cult here and die as a open govt secret with my body

- and yes, no sooner did i start war prep these flatlanders started killing russians on indian territory.. a good christian ("putin critic" and a successful businessman in russia at the same time?).. flatlanders will try to strain any good relation they see because they cant stand it.. they cannot tolerate the world coming together as one for any reason, let alone political ones

- i'm not a crap jesus, he is a backward suraj

- acche din bol ke nahi laye jaate, chupke se smuggle kiye jaate hain

- the world turns on a dime, i can hardly despair

- i poured myself out in a world where people have trouble letting go

- how to identify a flatlander
    - hurts more on seeing another's happiness than from their own misery
    - show off / ostentatious / verbose / narcissistic
    - talks about name/place/animal/thing more than ideas
    - asserts undue dominance / entitled behaviour
    - travels in a group / scared to be (or do stuff) alone
    - engages in one-upmanship
    - fundamentally ungrateful, "self-made" illusions
    
    
 - what has your love got to hide? 
 
 - a brahmin is one who can recall each one of his lifetimes with grand precision
 
 - ladkiyon ko kon naukri nahi deta? so i yelled for the boys
 
 -  but you know its true, too much porn and masaturbation will effectively turn you off towards real beauty, i saw beauty afresh with my new eyes
 
 - haggling is the essence of old money
 
 - did i just turn abnother profit over some more bullshit? is it really a one-up on wall-street? is this time truly different? are you kidding me?
 
 - we didn't want to be the good guys
 
 - the fact that i'm actually getting money still, effectively dissolves the cult, just a lot of wannabes and half-way crooks who took pity but only for the time being
 
 
 - ceaseless commerce with the earth
 
 
 - i owe gratitude, not shame
 

 - my life got turned upside down again as if it were possible, they were starting to talk about a new name for a generation, but like everything, it seemed faked and rehearsed, my tolerance for bullshit had increased
 
 
 - "surely, not all turnip hunters are joker collectors"
 
 
 - had i managed to pull off an orson welles level farce/hoax?
 


 - on being successful: omg just listen to tony robbins, you get very good results for flawless work, good for very good, nothing below that, the same applies to the inner world


 
 - do i really need the money? this could all still be just a scam and we could still be little better than destitutes for all i know, so, i decided to oblige and let the stupid play continue
 


 - that there were religious connotations to my life, which the mob waas basically trying to erase - that this happenned is a fact, the luck was in the knowledge that religious sentiments are pretty cheap
 


 - i cannot believe it has been nearly 40 years of me suggesting absolutely moronic shit and these guys implementing it as tech
 


 - people are born, i was summoned, but nobody could say why because they could not admit the why
 
 
 - insaan ko apni misery bhaut hi pyari hai, hence the commotion, people are so in love with what ails them, it's like they are all crucified on it, so was i .. it wasn't the case that i didn't know any better, rather was in some sense wedded to it, some kind of comfortable numbness that kept the world at bay. so when it was finally taken away, and the world rushed in, it was like a cold and nervous un-blanketing, a kind of quick peeling away of one layer of reality, to be replaced simultaneously by another later, which they insisted was their truth. the moral and material effects of this unsheathing didn't last for long, i did however see the world with new eyes, but it was no better or worse than the reality i already knew, just different. having seen all this, i proceeded in a clinical manner to detach myself from strong attachments. in this regard, relationships were the hardest, not drugs or sex as most would assume.


# Mar 

## - even in loving families like ours, there were basically two kinds of interaction, one was worrying, the other agenda - i guess the only disfunction then is the ratio of the two

# you must be an island unto yourself, life outside the coffin is but a temporary illusion

`hindu jagega nahi, toh sirf jalega

- most fact is opinion dressed in pretty words or backed by many mouths running on money, question everything

- the gravity of the situation is money temporarily became the measure of all things, and now, once again man has to be the measure of all things, this is realised but takes centuries to sink in 

- what is left for me to do but watch how they spend an inordinate amount of money just to get a rise out of me? my mission on earth was over before my 38th birthday - my days were somehow lighter still and each day more peaceful and full of surprises, new things to laugh at and new secrets to see, as i delved deeper into the pain of the weak and the cowardly - it was a drug like no other, and my apetite was insatiable by now - seeing as how i was only passing the time on earth,i did not kill myself for two reasons: 1) it gave me great pleasure to see their intraplanetary envy and 2) i was afraid they would kill the stupid woman if i killed myself - i was still able to entertain and instruct, the least of my pleasures was the knowledge that this had never happened to anyone in recorded history. no wonder i was hated, i was chosen by man and god alike. no wonder it was a tragedy for those who weren't.

- i worked only to give sustain the illusion of a momentum and the worldly pleasure that comes from completition, i had no external motivation to work but only an intrinsic one to play with the toys they were kind enough to leave around me


- my relation with muhammad and islam had taken a new turn perhaps, there were stories here i could not recall, but i can remember enough to know that we there was a great adventure in islam for me, not the hoors and luxuries of jannat but more arduous, difficult pilgrimages to undertake in different parts of the universe under this banner, stories of true friendship and good times too... stories that greatly informed my masculinity this time around, for reasons unknown


- if i had the fortune of living and dying at the hands of another human, no less from the other side of the planet, then i consider that an honor, what is more to add?


- it remained a mystery as to why i remained unmurdered, perhaps there was still profit to be made or maybe they were simply curious i would start levitating anytime, either way, each day on borrowed time is a blessing


- i never was capable of "just liking" anything or anyone, it was either hell yes or no, this was the key reason to my success and my haters could learn from this, instead of putting on a front for the sake of their mores


- the fact that my captors came off as "half way crooks" was proof enough of their innocence for me, realising that we were in a myth, i humbly offered my life


- myths don't start because someone wakes up one morning and decides to start one, they just do

- myths have nothing to do with countries, politics or economy but everything to do with the human condition, as a result blaming the other or yourself doesn't make any sense in a myth, but simply because you cannot blame the other should not mean you cannot call a spade a spade


- myth was the kindest interpretation i could summon of what was happening to me

- i don't call myself "woke" or anything of the sort, but if i was indeed "woke" in any sense of the word, the world outside had a huge role in bringing about my wokeness


- there was no more eagerness to change into anything or achieve anything or go on another conquest, but to merely rest before my final hour


- realising that if a large mass of humans hated me without having even met me, then it was entirely their misfortune i had come to represent, yet another reason why they sought to see me dead because it represented their liberation from the bondage of the body, mistakenly believing that i had to die before they could


- not knowing how much longer i had to go, i still was learning about humanity and how i could better interact with it, for example, one discovery i made was that i misjudged people not in that i was too trusting in them, but rather in their individuality, conveniently ignoring their chains in the hopes that they would come to see themselves as free if i did it first, but there was a learning curve - tldr: paid actors!

- i had gained more control over my lust - the recognition of greater pleasures had sucked me in gently but assuredly

- the story of impediments to human evolution is the story of learned helplessness at an individual level, this learned helplessness is also taken advantage of by incentivising it - a more ideal future would be one of a constant co-operative flux


- the whole idea of moving into higher dimensions of reality is to come to a standstill in this one, in the higher dimensions there all gradients are smaller and all contrasts are lighter throughouts - this is what communism got right but it was too early for mankind


- darwinian evolution can only lead to a plateatu, it could not predict that thoughts would one day become machine logs and man would be welded to satellites - the next mountain to climb for earthlings is to see this plateau more clearly - i was merely a guide through this uncanny valley of their progress, to me they were all mere pilgrims, to me, mankind was but a procession, though some tried to race each other within it


- i never fidget, i was taught to fidget, such was their jealousy -- this is what kittu tried to tell me


- the only competition is with the person you were, 5 minutes ago


- paying taxes means you did right by your fellow man who has been with you for many millennia, and because of whom you even exist, it is a small sacrifice for the greed and lust and torture we put each other through in the name of capitalism or evolution - tax evasion is an offence, tax avoidance is a game. without healthy taxation, capitalism is a matter of minutes


- i was still very much attached to the material world (family included), as if waiting for someone's permission to retreat into the forest and spend the last few weeks meditating and living off the land.. this was becoming pathetic .. but then i reasoned myself out of doing anything dumb because any spirituality that drives you out of the material was to me some sort of cowardice, the idea was to wake up inside the fire of the everyday life and not to become a mendicant until i had options, and become one with great pleasure and joy when all other options were exhausted

- the whole world cannot wake someone up, the need to arise and awaken comes from within so i don't bother with people because that isn't quite my pay grade


- capitalism is a matter of minutes, the complacency you have is unreal, today, capitalism is a matter of one backup forgotten

- religion is the most beautiful thing about the humans, putting language and imagination to good use in the service of curiosity, and they have some beautiful ones too, some of them were not there the last time i was around, but in the end, human religion is but a chocolate compared to my true religion, which is more like a seven course meal. but chocolate eaters cannot fathom, obviously so they attack me.

- as an analogy, religion is a mere frontend, god is the backend. the optimal energy has access to both with flawless precision, and yes it is true that doing one with precision enough leads to knowing the other but the route from frontend to backend is rather longer as compared with going from backend to front.

- no such thing as one true religion, the more frontends the greater chances of discovering our true cause. and humans are not at the stage at which they can imagine or construct multiple backends, but once they transcend time it becomes possible - getting them increasingly closer to the source at which point they will have merged into reality. the greatest irony is in the fact that the pace at which this happens isn't dependent or dictated by any law or covenant - but humans are known for their satisfaction and self-sufficiency. which alone makes any excursion to this planet a worthwhile endeavour.

- the thing about the source is it never ceases to sing... 

- people thinking porn is sin, but not eating meat? that's not how you get to where i'm from

- orgasm is the fingernail of the source's reflection, funny we have to work to get there.. being in the source is nothing like a perennial orgasm, but it paints a picture

- come to find earthlings still eating meat, was perhaps my only disappointment, i was expecting slightly different scenario on the food front but maybe that's why i was punished with food

- deja vu is your brother recognizing you

- so while they will still be cramming my words or analysing and studying them centuries after i am gone, they will learn at a pace set by middlemen they have never seen and likely will never know - we never visit to hasten their pace but to slow ours down

- in the source there is no difference between you and a photon, say

- our language is closer to german or sanskrit in that it is mathematical and precise, i enjoyed english so much precisely because it is flexible, something of a rebellion for me personally 

- but one of the questions i can answer is why. why do we visit when we know chocolate eaters evolve at their own pace? and that they regress to the mean, tyrna play catch up - every time, regardless of how many of us visit. we visit this planet to practice and learn restraint ... we visit for personal goals rather than out of any generosity towards the flatlanders, indeed we already know the treatment we shall receive but that's the point! for nobody could administer the brakes like this. to us the planet is a mere brake pad. the other point is to prepare the flatlanders for the next one, their whole purpose is this - to sustain for us their illusion.

- the brake pad analogy they understood even when i was a child, hence the threats to my toy cars..failed brakes and so on

- the misunderstanding here is that we seek to disrupt their illusion, when we only come to make their sleep sweeter still, but in misunderstanding sometimes they end up giving themselves nightmares... other times it isn't so much misunderstanding as a cringey horror at their distance from the source, and lacking any means or spiritual education for the access, they resort to violence and spectacle. it is ironic that we remind them of their own inadequacies, because we come to fulfill our own. none of us come to rock the boat, but others start rocking it upon seeing us.

- it isn't the case that the successive authority placed will always be a smart one, or even smarter than the previous one, but each has a distinctive quality and a unique signature that can be traced back to the source, i.e. you don't step in the same river twice, the same flows through you perenially

- source tells me that this room is more or less the same for each visitor, the rearrangement and moving furniture about is what distinguishes one from another -  in that we are distinguished only in activity 


- we need the brake pad because the speed in source is great and certain endeavours demand that we learn its ways beforehand, hence the exclave


- i am unique in that i can pretend to goof around more than necessary even at home, that i undertake any activity outside the source more casually than most, the distance from source isn't unique to chocolate eaters alone, but its nothing to aspire or even regress to


- i'm ok you're ok

- in a world where nobody could care less about each other, these foreigners chose to stick around us, study and raise us (while apologizing in some indirect terms for it), even if (or precisely if) only to kill us, is it a wonder we were somehow lucky, risen? they were getting nothing special from us, narcissism, attitude, war, and data they could get from elsewhere in a country of billions (and for cheaper too, by now, thanks to us), or could they? why were we at the receiveing end of such unending human grief? who were we? were we the only ones or were there others like us out there? i guess these were the questions to which i would never find the answers to. but they had considerable investment in their chains is what it appeared to be. were they really that backward or did spewing hate randomly serve an evolutionary purpose? did they hate me enough to kill me? or merely enough to hang around forever and do some corruption?


- everyone is adept at corruption but only a few can truly establish trust, most people can spend decades trying to no avail - most others don't like trust in the first place and regard it as a necessary evil pegged on claims of moral superiority. and while in an ideal world perhaps capitalism can become a trustless machine (we tried and failed at exactly this, which is saying something about our apetite for a better world), but the legal systems can only process so much and people are unable or unwilling to think beyond legal terms.


- what runs the monkey world, for the most part is learned helplessness of each, my solution was not to unlearn the helplessness but to learn helpfulness


- pure death, emissary of potenial 
  the jewel of horizon
  now unreachable 
  
  
  - i wrote utterly beautiful code and produced very high quality software products because there was nothing else in the rat race that could hold my interest anymore, a semblance of a vocation had to be maintained for society's sake, even though society was fed up of it own prisons and even as they tempted me with a cancerous "carrer" and poisonous salary, they knew they had lost and would continue to lose for a long time, or until they had nothing left to lose, whichever first. but they still didn't get it, which was wonderful to behold - even if only as a simple observation of humanity, it was funny because they had all the control over the narrative, and yet, as far on earth as the eye could see and ear could hear, there was nothing. as if the world had come to a standstill, there were no more pandemics, nobody was getting raped and murdered, no banks were being robbed, just the usual.. the world had once again regained its prison status, and what everyone got was routine and more routine, though even in my copied-left dreams there were whiffs of a revolution brewing in some corner of a vengeful and just eye.
  
- context should always be the context and not try to be the reality, there's always trouble when context bubbles forth into reality with expectations and dreams, brahmin that becomes or sets the context should always work behind the scenes and never crave limelight.

- the number 4 is pure brinkmanship of god, those who wake up here wake up in 3, 2, 1 and reach 0 well within time, others are not so lucky.

- the only privacy is the privacy of the grave, the rest is but illusion until proven otherwise... and in heaven everything is free and everything is open obviously, there is a crypt in hell though, where something like the idealised form of the concept is trapped, but even hell owners don't care much for it.
  
 - welcome to planet earth, circa 21st century -- where half of them are butthurt and the other half jealous = half of them born with a palsy the other half with some sort of iodine deficiency, which is why i had to be birthed as collateral for war, purged in front of a global audience after nearly 4 decades of being tortured in a panopticon, and you still want to bring kids into this world?
 
 
 - ww3 might be fought the last war fought with actual weapons, ww4 will be completely invisible, virtual - fought on the infinite theater of war that is the human mind, that is how kaliyuga will come to an end - will you be there? - if you think you can stop this from happening, you are living in a delusion and narrative. you won't think anymore, only fight until you die - think advertising as a low quality simulacra of this never ending conflict
 
 
 - freedom is free, it is the culture that takes its toll
 
 
 - i see any business i might start a skunkworks within GS, which has the blessings of GS to someday outgrow it, what these people are incubating is beyond my current mental bandwidth,but i don't seem to have the intent or the motivation to do much
 
 
 - i'm in the certainty business, eliminate all doubt and fear
 
## life isn't protocol, but any diplomatic effort in the name of greater peace is almost entirely protocol. in it's entirety, the movement from birth to death cannot be accurately portrayed by language which is a subset of life, that's hegel 101. there's no such thing as pure unadulterated truth. perhaps the only pure truth is mortality, the rest is narrative courtesy of your DNA and the envioronment. seems obvious when you think about it, but the obvious is a great hiding place.

## invitations disguised as challenges suck, there are people out there that don't take challenges from outside, i'm one of those.

## life is grand opera, anything less is a compromise, no wonder they hate 

## i had better prayers and muses, export-quality dreams, so guess what i did?

## the thread of consciousness is connected all the way back to its origin, consciousness IS the middleman, negotiate your own freedom

## one afternoon, whilst i sat miking my favorite cow, the neighbours came and encircled me in absolute silence, now i know why

## i eliminated choice itself, rationality was far behind now

## marxism summarised: `history is what you CHOOSE to remember, usually the stories of those who won because you are programmed to by their decsendents and those who profited from winning. this makes history a prize worth killing for, to me it was not more what i chose to remember in the last 5 minutes`, and not because i was not interested in winning at all, decades of received failure will teach you to keep a low profile - but my ego and vanity were unabashed and who doesn't want $20?. however, usually `those who win are called the "rich", this creates class struggle`. although it needn't, but the poor are equally greedy. but upon seeing the class struggle, i had to decide if i wanted to exploit my somewhat unique status amongst the "rich" - `the central friction in the state of play was my reluctance to get involved. who could deny me my reasons?` on top of that, my choice was not an explicit ask by a physical presence of those asking me to do myself and them a favor, but totally a manipulative, narcissistic double bind, a bomb not worth diffusing so i stepped aside. these people came seeking a theater, so decided to give them one, they came back for more, so i gave two. `i haven't heard from them in the past 10 minutes`.

## they came bearing electric toothbrushes and promises of jetpacks

## i'm no saint for sure, but the ecstasy is just as real

## OSHO is a shapeshifter, he can inflate himself to be bigger than he is, something few can pull off, this makes people jealous

## one of the main discerments in any spiritual life is to not confuse the frontend for the backend, it is middlemen all the way until the source, although rare middlemen represent what they bring clearly enough to be labelled themselves god, thats ok. people doing god's work surely deserve the nameplate, but the person is not the nameplate.

## violence is how winning is done, and i hadn't the heart for it, much preferred to play the victim,if only to sooth hurt egos

## if you want to end up at 99, you must first be 100

## your salvation is SO not my problem, work it out on your own. it is a problem i've been taught to want, while in truth working out my own is a job enough. work on the problem you have, not the problem you want to have #mentalmodels

## in the end, only kindness matters

## given the option between choosing a position in which neither i nor the race-minded come off as cowards, and one where i come off as a coward, i will probably pussy out - not only because of the mythical angle but also because i was quite thoroughly turned off by the whole concept of marriage, not to mention the excessive gatekeeping (even for a myth, things went beyond tribal), and a friendship for sex's sake didn't exactly seem worth it. i was a lone wolf at heart and thus preferred to stick to this core fact. a hippy-dippy pretend suburban marriage sponsored by anyone seemed a wholly repugnant idea. especially when the fruits of solitude had just begun to ripen.


## i told them i've been writing billy joel's songs but they didn't believe


## learn pain management from the blind, nightmare management from us

## if you found god would you want to play a finite game with him?


- war is a shell for peace

- how can i be sure mouldybread doesn't have flying monkeys of her own bent on self destruction? i cannot, better the devil you know. by now it sure does feel like she as a host of "students" who wouldn't bat an eyelid before taking me out.


- consider what's happenning here as a very kind of , low kind of low energy politics, supposedly at gunpoint although nobody's complaining as of yet.


- i have to balance egos by becoming empty of self, you're talking to my stomach really


- just because some lie is worth believing doesn't mean you should buy it


- main khud ko bahut fanney khan samajhta tha, kuch na bacha


- great humility was drilled into me with the kind of precision the world reserves for dampening revolutions


- i donated my carrer, alongwith my mind and body for greener pastures and the chance to keep my soul alive in a dead world, nothing personal


- the world is public by design, erecting walls without and within is just an evolutionary trait of egos


- my main idea is to "produce more than you consume" and i found a way to produce something every living second, if i profited off it, it was only because i also paid in special taxes for the right to do so. and in doing so, we were able to guide and improve the world, so why do these people keep crying again?


- to be or not to be is an old problem, also known as to return or not to return, because being is eternal return #newontology 🪶


- you made your father as much as he made you  #newontology🪶


- just as i, who was used to saying "yes" had trouble in saying "no", so the naysayers, who are accustomed to saying "no", now have trouble saying "now"


- #TILFI narcs are easy to please


- history is gossip, writ large
- christian repression is back


- there can be no enlightenment without breaking god's heart


- hell is an empty park where the trees hide their shameful roots with a low-hanging fog and an infinite cacophony of voices, each identifiable to a memory, echoes forever in a song 


- no such thing as "toxic masculinity", just women explaining shit 


- the efficacy of rudraksh is greatly eroded


- i think we should see in our lifetime a reverse brain-drain if my calculations are right #bets


- is this the last time a whole nation, a whole race cowered behind a prostitute?


- when they assume they will discuss my openly after i'm gone, what do they mean? really discuss how they had to hide behind bread and breed and raise a human just to be tortured? fools! the likelihood of something that could be repressed for 60 odd years ensures the liklihood it has been buried for good. this is civilisational #decline, we just put it in front of a screen for all to enjoy and be forewarned by learning from the symptoms. 


- lately coming to understand that how #democracy manages to scrape along is that there is some sort of a general, empathic intelligence amongst the electorate, nobody could predict a Trump win but in the end the people chose the lesser weevil, and this isn't saying anything personal about the Clintons, they know the truth as well as anyone and were perhaps no less deserving but the whole election just goes to prove how I had become the single source of truth for a lost peoples.


- i didn't come here to serve a zombie career, but to start a fire and some fire i did start!


- i got as far as i got by not letting a morsel of monkey judgement stick to me


- large corporations rule over you to the extent of your own greed 


- people who are used to sell their soul piecemeal couldn't understand my business was wholesale 


- this i must remember, that i'm telling not to fill a bottomless bucket to ppl who have been doing so for centuries and barely getting by.. presenting them a world view vastly different than the stories they have hitherto believed in and faithfully committed to, proving a vastly different model of what is out there in an environment where the common man is paranoid and anxious about the future he might receive from them.


- hard work is a cop out if your soul isn't in it, faking it works for simple minds more than it works for the relatively educated and conditioned mind, you can fake hard work but the output will be alienated, there is freedom in creativity and truly creative work is priced better 

- i think the female monkeys started mirroring the brinkmanship that was my style and it ended badly, the essence of my story is basically this, people tried to imitate, and tried hard, but could not. and while life is largely monkey-see-monkey-do, some people are better at somethings and others simply aren't. the hyperreal nature of the experiment being run wasn't for everyone, though it brought about a vastly superior planet at scale. however, as usual the monkeys in power couldn't bear the imagined loss, and this this monkey was kept locked up and afraid. they couldn't take their eyes off because to live like i did obviously meant a world of pure potential for the human race and they couldn't emulate because their history taught them otherwise, and they had their own psychological proclivities or were simply not educated to see beyond their narcissistic ends.

- once they had concluded that it was "difficult, but not impossible" being me, they hung around because :
  - we stood as great stand-ins for war and destruction
  - our poise under pressure was truly something to behold, among other things that the world learnt by watching us
  - they needed a reason to fight and fuck and wake up in the morning, being simply bored out of each other


- so then, the pleas for behaviour change came more out of a recognition that they were stuck than out of anything else at all, sure there ran a couple of markets over my head and sure this meant i could be taken out at a moments notice, but it wasn't clear exactly how much money was at play in said markets (one imagines not much) and in which currency but surely if they were making enough out of no inducements to change and no temptations, then they would have not bothered.

- i had broadcasted myself to the world from the DNA up, nothing earthly could frighten me anymore

- i was a pluripotent cell in the sea of humanity

- One good thing about these days is more ppl are asking better questions
Glacial progress, unlike renaissnce/reformation when shit spread like fire precisely becuse it had room to spread and ignorance to conquer

- Now ppl are born woke into the matrix

- There is nothing you cannot know, it was a pleasure finding god and broadcasting his presence at such a time, if only to see what did next
But the flip is the matrix gets denser, which makes moving forward in time without faith in a historic sense isnt feasible
Geography is dead and time has collapsed, and yet they were bothered with trifles like oil, culture nd money

- Hidden neurosis and mental illnesses had better and more democratic outlets


Women are insane so i stay away, even, if not especially online
Something about me especially brings out the crazy in them
consider also the power they have over me, a dog turned inside out, it made no sense to not keep things strictly platonic for the rest of the mission

Love is not mere willingness to play power games (in the bedroom or outside)
It is an enlightened surrender of self interest (enlightened as in not via self-harm, crying in a bugatti is not a solution, also if you don't commit self harm you are likely not to harm others)

Whether, through such interaction you manage to keep your self respect, is a matter of political skill

that david grew into his feminine side because of me was a matter of personal satisfaction, he had discovered more space within too for this i was glad. but the whole thing was a headscratcher and i didn't want to mess with it anymore. knowing, nay finding that peace was only within and without was just a war, i reverted to my crab self.

although throughout my journey i encountered many supernatural spectacles, from the stationary dragonflies hovering over a pond to dungbeetles' poo and what it represented, to witnessing the dance of fireflies and feeling as if it was indeed, like most else things in my life - orchestrated and at some level synthetic, to having deep conversations with nature and myself - including parts of myself i did not know existed until the inquisition brought them out one by one. from swimming in himalayan rivers (or trying to anyway) to discovering the magic of computer science firsthand all the while suffering a whole new dimension of abuse since childhood - and yet, despite having witnessed all this, not being surprised in the least, this is perhaps the greatest miracle of all. the recognition that mankind had managed by a great trick and slight, to make an insect out of itself.

- Whatever China can make I can make orders of magnitude better (and am currently doing so, becoming better at it each day), not only that I can use Chinese stuff as raw material and make  orders of magnitude better stuff from that too, but it seldom happens that I find anything Chinese that truly inspires lately. On top of that I am acting alone, as an individual under western scrutiny, AND am quite lazy. This isn't to exalt my own greatness, but to hint at their status as a legless hedgemon. That is what being insular does to a society, we should strive to be more open. China has ossified politically, culturally, and finds hard to believe its "world domination" mixtape isn't winning hearts anymore. It isn't that the party is lacking anything, or the #leadership any weaker. Just a sign of the times perhaps, a time for regeneration from this feverish lull at seeing we can do surveillance better too, not just english.

---

- I love the Chinese but do not compete with them, or anyone else for that matter.

- I am what I echo, and what echos through me

- The definitive moment of decline of a society is a great time to ask, what did it do right? not just focus on why it is dying or what it did wrong.

- the americans were at a crossroads, if they chose not to accept my blessings, it would be decline-as-usual, and if they did, it would be decline spectacular au lait. better the devil you know.


- the reason i don't do leetcode is, why would I? when i can deploy own product...? salary dreams are dead unless the cult dissolves i seem to be on wheels. your leetcode score is nothing but your willingness to solve the capitalist's problem for a corporate slavery, though lately they make it very comfortable. leetcode is just glorified upwork.


- i think the days of unipolar hedgemons are over, and the era of "groupings" is about to end, it is each country for itself in who gets to shape the global narrative now. as for democracy, it is all about "showing" the right amount of #power through the mandate. 


- i just needed a new idea


- my thoughts on #python had not changed as a result of deeper explorations (multithreading/multiprocessing), the GIL was a thorn and workarounds were not worth the effort, overall #python was useful as a sidearm at best, and that too until something else takes its place. Multithreading was fast in only certain situations and in my case proved to be 3x slower than multiprocessing. Multiprocessing was "not slow", and felt more safer than the immediate competition. Overall, you can crunch numbers fairly well, esp with CPU bound optimisations but otherwise its 50-50.


- it isnt that these people didn't understand that the further i was kept locked away and isolated, metaphorically in the underground, the more the situation became a flashpoint. no it was very much the case that mother nature was wet for war, once again fertile for a harvest of blood. so me and mother were kept under the watchful eye and a narrative was spun around us common folk. surely, mere money laundering and "corruption" wasn't the end sought here. nor was the only end our needless humiliation and persecution, these folk really wanted to go down in history as someones, or merely go down. if not that, what was their end game? were they only here to hear, confess and apologize like they couldn't do back home? was this pin-hole camera across two tents merely a democratic device shaping the future of the world at large? surely if war was the motive, it became my duty as a human to ask for my own death instead, but if they only wanted skirmishes and war-games, they were spending too much money.. for those could have been had cheaper, right here if not elsewhere.


- my job was to warn people, so i did the best i could given my own personal circumstances.


- evolutionarily speaking it was to my advantage to think as if i was the only one in this panopticon, although here may well have been others like me, i had no proof of this, nor was the narrative spun around me constitutive of any evidence towards the contrary


- i think the people holding out any great expectations from me were always going to be disappointed, 40 years of real-time existential threat, humiliation and torture had sapped every desire out of me and the only option remaining was to do religion, which is proof that they wanted a war, for what better reason other than religion to make stupid masses fight and produce and consume more. if they didn't want war, they would have kept me occupied in other stuff.


- so i found that there are basically three kinds of buddhists out there (its a hierarchy), and i'm not talking denominations. the first are the majority on the bottom - insincere and misguided, these are lost souls who have no idea why they are buddhists in the first place, and if you ask them they wouldn't be able to explain - and this majority includes some buddhist clergy, many of them active on youtube. the second are those not without some guidance, whether internal or imbibed,  these are a very thin minority at various stages of progress. the third is the creme de la creme, these people have achieved true buddhahood and should be emulated, they are obviously the fewest in numbers.


- staying silent for extended periods of time was so sweet, it was the best thing i ever tried and realised 90% of words that get exchanged between people can be effectively done away with; though going silent like this is far from the norm in any society, yet a healthy practice - especially in my case, given the things i had witnessed #meditations #MENTALHEALTH

# NEKI KAR, KUWEN MEIN DAAL


- 2023 has been one hella year, i did not expect this much from life frankly. to think i tried so hard at administrative services and today the entire lobby is jelly


- lcb = let me count my blessings


- to say nothing of the purely spiritual joyride situation - the very least of the fruits of being me


- the sense or ability to surprise which i presumed had been "robbed" or taken from me... from this lack flowered a most beatiful eternal surprise, to the point that i had to write some religious themed poetry just to express how i felt, which, imho is much more embarassing than merely having sex or masturbating in public, this was not exactly what i had planned


- no longer was a tree a mere tree, not in a childish sense of wonder but in a very visceral way my reality had extruded into itself, and infinitely so  - they did so much dirty capitalism around me i was bound to discover an inner capital 


- the ecstasy of my being invited death as af it were a sojourner, no wonder the freight train passengers were envious 


- enough bhaktiras to drown into, no doubt, but also swim in your corner of human evolution with dignity, and yet remaining unmurdered 


- the gratitude of not only having a personal god, but also withstanding his vicissitudes 


- the happiness from having truly skilled-up in yet another craft


- the joy of hard-won philosophical skepticism and doubt melting away, chipping away, eroding in each direction


- the results of experimenting with truth, finding it out, figuring out my location in the grand scheme of things and the consequent satisfaction, which allowed me to be creative, if only to give back


- the sheer thrill of driving a train over eggshells (with flawless precision), though entirely a narcissistic enterprise, not without its sinful pleasures


- in my case, even recalling the lessons learnt the in school of hard knocks was somewhat pleasureable maybe because of the sheer scale of the shaggy dog story i was in, suited my vanity just fine


- the knowledge that i am too dumb to transcribe what is happening to me in a manner precise enough for my own standards, the hope that maybe someone someday will be able to tell this story better than i can -- in my defense, i could only write so much when each waking moment was kind of a painting


- the quiet ecstasy of watching the grand drama of life unfold before my eyes, blinding me to shallow concerns most have to deal with


- the indifference of having walked through the underworld, having seen humanity under the hood and having found it no better than it's 5 second old iteration, still fighting against its own history rather than accepting the obvious lessons from it


- the ego stroke of having dealt with the other with my self-respect intact


- the humility of having been one among the first to play a game which will either never be remembered or will be played by all one day


- when i say that "log apne dukh se kam dusro ki khushi se jyada dukhi hain" does it not also apply to me? isn't at least part of my own sorry stemming from seeing the pleasure of others? #mentalmodels


- heaven is not a highway rather a rarely traversed trail through the woods, no wonder to the highway-dwellers it seems odd and tragic


- it was not the case that i was particularly committed to writing the next great computer language, not knowing how certain my future was, i was merely happy being the least productive i could be, just enough so it didn't feel like i was not earning my keep on the planet, nor was it true that i was wedded to tech as a means of proving my worth, but i was given the resources and time so it didn't feel right to waste them.


- main kya leke aya tha? shareer maa baap ne diya, aatma parmatma ne di, jagat ne jigyasa di aur guru ne maut, yahan maut bhi apni nahi #mentalmodels #meditations


- the deeper my meditation became, the freer i was


- i have forgotten more than how it feels to hold a woman, i have forgotten what physical touch entails, maybe its for the best - not sure if i was repressing sexuality or was it truly vanishing as a result of my spiritual practices and isolation forced upon me -- the self love was still there -- in fact the self-love had matured beyond simpleton activities like fapping and i was able to appreciate my condition better - except for the withdrawal and recoil, which wasn't my fault - i was happy to oblige the peeping toms but not at the cost of my self respect


- one consciousness per universe


- beauty is important, but suffering is supreme, suffering is primal, the root of which - a simple habit - though beauty is strictly speaking, more a matter of chance than suffering - beauty is retailed while suffering is humanity's wholesale business .. and while other animals may also feel emotions/cry etc, human "dukkha" is worth its weight in gold


- when you wake up, you will wake up out of all old habits until waking up becomes the only habit


- to me, there was little difference my desire for a woman and my desire for, say, a turnip, it was all melting up inside into a sweet ecstasy


- any "grand unifying theory" cannot be mere science, nor mere religion but a combination of both - just as a superset cannot be described by a subset alone #settheory #categorytheory

- the reason i won't write about science, the scientific method, or something to be peer-reviewed is not because i don't think i can, but because there is little imagination left in science or scientific method, its a clusterfuck and i might as well be creating my own genre

- i am biologically incapable to do depression or mental illness of any kind, which is all the more reason to be skeptical about the content of my thoughts lately, especially when the game will have me believe that there are no co-incidences, there are infact many. the randomness in the world is an undeniable fact, irrespective of how conditioned one is, whether we can use it for profit or not is another question.

- #wokewords BHAVSAGAR

- now there was only conditioning of all these years reproducing itself, my sanskar had me by the balls and there was little i could do but stay on repeat


- contrary to popular belief, i was not taking any political stance, whether over personal or public matters


- #wokewords parthenogenosis


- "the tao that can be talked about is not the tao", so the tao that can be talked about in fewer words/characters is closer to itself, than the tao that needs more words, herein lies the secret of twitter's success #mentalmodels


- its not that i'm not building the product of my dreams because i want to live, it is genuinely the case that i'm out of ideas


- #fml


- i wonder if someday in the distant future, someone is going over these words and thinking wtf


- ladies and gentlemen, the 21st century just got real, and also unreal. what the lower classes and less educated,and others given to generally epicurean natures must understand that anything beyond theory is that things only ever get realtively real, people taking politically extreme stances


- to take a stand in politics, whether local or global, means to commit to some one thing, at least one but two is a risk, make sure it is worthwhile, but ideally one should not commit to opinions - a position diametrically opposite to the trans people, for example, who will commit to an idea enough to hurt themselves -- it all makes one wonder if it all starts with making small cuts, is cutting a gateway drug? fucking masochists.


- death within death


- pain within pain


- did someone out there really see me as a slave to anyone when i was enjoying late capitalism this thoroughly? surely they were entitled to their humungos egos


- what are they going to tell the children? that its all opinion? as if the kids don't already know this? #zizek

- making education a more lucrative business is exactly one of the purposes of #gg

- it wasn't even a matter of faith anymore, these people had already crossed over and made me cross over, making a cultural 'X' over the pages of history, geography, science and of course, other social sciences


- our mission wasn't anti-feminist, it was humanist, and therein was the blessing and the curse #gg

- i was am and will remain a student, given how resistant to change and clingy i was

- in fact that is perhaps my secret, i needed more than others, because i was already entrusted with much history, more was given to me

- just because we were being lulled and lowered into a kind of fake complacency of "money", i rose up and decided to see it all for what it was worth, which was precious little so there was no reason to act as anything but casual, even if someone were to drill a hole in my head, i could not be "unseated"


- money is nothing, if someone dislikes you and wants to get rid of you, they can, you can never be safe, so was i now given something i should be afraid to lose? or something to hold on to so tightly that i sould worry about it deserting me? balderdash, just because certain mental reactions may be evoked in you by the other proves nothing about the nature of habit OR behaviour. though you can study someone's behaviour a great deal, and for long enough that you have predictive certainty over his decision making, you can never predict what a conscious human whether sane or insane might do next, not in the least when you have availed the opportunity of humbling yourself before him, and then extracted your righteous humility out of him. for one, my humanism enabled me to play long term games with others, which was something to behold. #consideryourselfdead


- really i love the 90s because there still was a whiff of libertarianism in the air, as opposed to the current saffron lull, painted auburn, sandblasted and air brushed and photoshopped and autotuned bullshit


- in prise of boredom, boredom is posh isloation

- "synthetic biology" may yet have its uses, for example skin suits for bipedal robots

- perhaps quantum computing is being suppressed because the masses are not yet ready for the concept, it certainly appreared so from my pov

- once you start seeing your conditioning, you can begin to change, i was amazed at my semen retention lately, was it merely religion? sure there was some trauma mixed in, or was it the ratio? or was it that i was thoroguhly pissed off? #potscrapings


- life is not a sickness unto death, rather a death unto itself, how i had ignored Hegel for so long, so enamoured was i by the king of hipsters


- one virtue by which reality is far more hegelian than ever is that nobody believs in shit anymore, its not just Ukraine, its a giant fog of nihilism and apathy and complacency than hangs over all of us, while the planet is fiddling while rome burns, Putin's warnings seemed untimely


- #wokewords syzygy

- a murder is an abortion from inside out

- i think we as a family unit were compensated with culture in exchange of our lives, maybe not a trend, not a global sensation, but a phenomenon in its own right, about which i will be writing till the end, praises of such a miracle of humanity can never end


- i was the only one celebrating an occasion the whole world had chosen to sleep on


- i was like a work of art hanging behind someone's screen, i had exactly zero responsibility, and yet i toiled to the extent i believed was justified, this was pure conditioning

- the world is to be lost


- were they really trying to tell me that i had lust enough in me to betray my samadhi? kids, this is what happens. i very much doubt i could be compensated enough now to have sex on camera outside of a situation involving hostages and/or semi-automatic machine guns, no matter how hot the girl. yet, for  the right person at the right time, i was not hesitant to play the porn star for a while. samadhi shamadhi. i could just not be manipulated into it, i would also do it for certain orders from the tribe elders, out of respect. but i really doubted this would ever come to pass, i just wanted to last longer without fapping, and now that i could, it felt real good.


- i do believe i can and will defend their right to mess with my food in this lifetime, regardless of consequences. but more then that i cannt stand by. the consequences of messing with a brahmins food, let a alone a kshatriya's food, are as certain as the consequences of taking mnoney from a jew


- may the lord lead ye to the truth #blessings


- the truth has to be as bland as it is interesting, otherwise we would be jumping out of our skin by now


- once you realize you are above the law, you don't need to go beyond it, but one does wonder if the cult and/or ritual sacrifice was worth the consequences
 
- once you see you are beyond social norms, you must try to bring others up to your level rather than sink to theirs, that's how it has always been

# why i burnt my passport #essay

> this isn't an exclusive, elitist, socialist club but a way to live not only beyond all current socio-economic labels, but also stripped off all extant ones, hence the hype

`my outward situation was simple, if i am a true genius, i would not get recognised during my lifetime, if i am not, i will be`. either way, it mattered little to me because i took the term genius very lightly.



i did away with my passport, voowing not to go outside india not because i sought safety (nor was i offerred any here), but because i had demonstrably proven the country to be behind on any narcissistic index, though i did not always think so, i had to conclude so. besides, some missions can only be completed behind the garb of such an identity


don't think i can leave tech in the hands of ppl so ashamed of how they have (ab)used it, that they cannot even face this fact


as for the "fiction" i'm trying to write, do they really think i can consider the opinions of those borrowing my style and learning from watchng me?


let time tell the story of which team of beggars won this stupid, childish argument, i don't want anything from them.

lying does not exist, it is impossible to lie, you can be momentarily distracted by someone, or duped but "lie" is itself already a fabrication, a lie is itself a lie, even the truest of true things is a lie in some respect. 


most of what people say you can read on their bodies plainly most of the time, if someone is highly trained in hiding their body language, they may persuade you - but that speaks for your own lack of skills in recognizing the other. i'm saying there is no lying, there is either just an inability or unwillingness to see the truth. or a failure to communicate fearlessly. this is why lying works as a great flirtation technique, it makes for a tittilating experience to hear statements obviously untrue stated as if they were true to create tension/drama. sometimes people lie just because they need that drama in their life.

sometimes ppl kill just for the drama.

#COM superheroes make for great symptoms of what afflicts us today, i'm not in favor of being called by a superhero name because these brands should not be tainted by the shadow of war, however artificial, that has decided to follow my body.. not only because it would be unfair to everyone, but also because it is unfruitful culturally/economically. teletubbies are the ultimate superhero story / war propaganda. 


---

#COM The reason I did not want to start some revolution by acknowledging the politics around me, was that i didn't want the support of a collective (nor did i ever feel supported enough to take a conscious political stance), indeed i was tolerated at best, on a physical level. So it was right to let bygones be bygones and continue my spiritual journey with as little public interaction as possible. The weight of lonliness could never crush me the way others can. Moreover, it was evident that americans as a people are lost for reason, in this state, they were better left alone, with all my thanks. Yes, the story and the message was best to be deleted, a shaggy-dog-story as i always said, even if it was one that left the world recently deflowered.

#ssf the reason they keep coming back is that i allow them to express themselves more fully than others would, suffering fools gladly is the essence of my being

i was no faith healer but if the hardest hearts on wall street and around the world could soften then that was my reward for existing

i think they stuck around because there was meaning in my life for people who had become machines, ossified in one way of doing things that the alternative as a fantasy they could not achieve, nor forget... the world, as it were, masturbated for the first time through me, which in turn became my reason for sannyas 


---


contrary to popular belief, porn was the greatest compass into my inner emptiness, and thus a great way to explore oneself without needing the other, porn and masturbation save lives, but it was time to "grow up" and aim a little higher


---


i am sure there are people out there who had to play a negative role in my life just to prove a point that there is negative in the world, and we must shield ourselves, it is exactly for these people that i came for, so you see me struggling hard for their souls. their betterment was my lifelong mission, not because they came and chose to stick around, but because i knew how deep their sicknesses went and was rather comfortable in that pool of abuse ... partly Hanlon's razor #mentalmodels but also faith that even the staunchest opposition has to come to some baseline agreement to even be brought to the table. indeed, if consensus could form it could be made into a big deal, but perhaps i was too idealistic, or was programmed to be idealistic so i could suffer in that stew. But I leveraged the symbiosis of our relationship as much as I could without takiing undue advantage.

LUCKILY my #idealism was greater and won - and i was able to create, out of the ashes of a quick justice that incited the jelousy of the planet, a life of engrossing interest far outside the realm of the understanding of any majority. As for the zimbardo effect rolling around me, their #evil was easily forgiven, even if there was no compensation for it - any fool could see the future of humanity itself was at stake, and i had chosen a future free from fear, so fear insisted at first, but then it was just a bunch of people being vulnerable cunts and powerless punters - it was a collective dream dreamt outwards into the future, ultimately fanning out like a river delta - the veins of an ever flattening universe.

In the end, I was left duped and ashamed of my ambitions to take on the world. All hope had been lost, all trying was futile. From here on in, it was just some mechanical whiling away until something interesting happens, which I prepared for. Moral of the story was still #zen, don't be too idealistic.

it wasn't so much about humanity, humanity we had covered by being inhumane, but what was remaining once everything human was accounted for, the kind of chance encounter that made even the skeptic, cynical core of my being doubt how real reality really is. maybe by exposing ourselves thus, there secreted through the soul of Adam, a kind of abcess of peace, a small eruption of the inverse of inhumane reasoning, or no reasoning, or reasoning out of greed alone, or the reasoning of lesser greeds -- thus was there born in the world a new kind of peace -- not a status quo per se -- but a thin, transparent sheath of hypocrisy (as understood by decades worth of data and observations) -- which in my estimation could protect the people from one another, and keep the coming generations at a relatively greater peace. how long could this new improved hypocrisy last for? at the time of the current writing, i could not forsee any major theater deployment by any sensible nation-state for the next two decades. i cannot recall the last time earth was so bootstrapped and yet so hopeful, even manali was uncharacteristically crowded for the season.

i'm 37 and can with some confidence allude to the hereafter, but words fall short - for all my grasp of the English language, there isn't a quotable avenue for the transcendent - thus i gravitated towards math, but it was there that i found, at best, reasons that stated precisely why languages are destined to fall short in any exposition of the real - maths was on its knees there and physics stood in the corner laughing an uncertain, incredulous laugh. perhaps all visions at the edge of human evolution are passed over in silence, even though not all are sinister, that i was able to record even this much was a priviledge. also i don't want to spout spiritual mumbo jumbo without being certain of what i was saying. but for my time on the planet, all i could with resolute certainty say is that sense data was not the whole story. so, one could say i was a taoist/daoist in this regard. also i recognized my own vanity behind attempts at understanding and explaining my pov to the other, so these notebooks would have to suffice #poubellication

# Jul 

## 1

- #humility i was a petered down excuse of a man, wonder why they couldn't get enough


- looking at things from a strictly egoist #perspective simplified a lot of my backstory to me, as confusing and enchanting as it was


- a new freedom was upon me, which was ironic to say the least because i felt about as free as a log of driftwood going downstream


- i think i lost my mojo at the sight of not so much the people that surronded me, nor their manipulating and narcissistic behaviour, but rather at the fucked up relation they had with religion, and by extension, language. which was, in turn a reflection of (in my estimation) of the relations amongst them - even within my own family, the toxicity was nothing imported, but once i saw the truth, much of the errant patterns of behaviour and psych got dealt with for good

- even now there was a sensation of flattening, i became like a coin, forever suspended mid-toss

- the most unimaginable of things was still that i survived, more or less unharmed - the risk fluctuated but i remained vigilant, never letting my guard down for anything

- i wasn't paranoid, just alert, a heightened awareness to the point that i could "see" thought as just electrochemical activity
  
- i felt submerged as a drop, like a little yes in an ocean of yes-buts
 
- i became an instrument unto myself

- unfathomable depths 

- the age of the accidental wars was upon the planet, a time where one might as well attribute a fruedian slip of the tongue to total global thermonuclear teardown - the road forward, ever clear, was not well-lit for there were no more wars to wage, except perhaps the last and final one - and that was the biggest pill to swallow here, not that an Intelligence created by us would take over, but that we will volunteer to let it   

- i think there is a global intelligence, and conversely a global stupidity that shapes our lives

- all i need is occasion to apologize, to humble myself yet again, but why?

- #remotework is more moral because if youre serious there is less scope for a holiday, the output of #remotework can even be less alienating

- test from mobile

- at this point it is near impossible to say  whether i am assembling a team, or a team is putting together parts of me long lost


- my sincere advice to washington and the powers that be is to let sleeping dogs like, there ain't no revolution here, nor does it seem likely anyone could win the nobel or even the pulitzer for telling this "story", in fact i would go so ofar as to say that some stories are not worthy of a telling. moreover, it is calculable how much damage to the established order such a story made explicit could do. then there's the mythological angle. how long does it take from things being a joke to a self-fulfilling prophecy? sleep on sleeping on. i've already done what i came to do and will happily make a pittance for my efforts for the rest of my life. no problem.


- i have this recurring notion that satori/death cannot be a static fixed location but a fluid range of conscious activity that is single-minded enough to be called "concentration", yet diffused enough to form a samadhi or near-samadhi 


# AUG 

# 06

- i'm not one to be bogged down by adversity, and discovered time and again that i could, even under depraved situations, turn a living. but at the same time i could not see the point in greed anymore - remembering social upwards mobility could be halted, if not reversed at any time - but also, perhaps more importantly, the recognition of the rat race for what it is, left me permanently bent towards a narrow, spiritual and solitary life.

> #ssf if i were to tell my story, surely the words "dear mr sharma, the mercedes is back to square one." ought to be a fitting start

> the summer within me was something money couldn't buy, hence the wall street sannyas

- my aim was now to find as many ways of remembering to be present as possible

> any language works much the same way a photograph does, in that it tries to distill state into a medium, the thus loaded medium then acts as an input to a polynomial-time function to be decoded and understood. language is not an apriori system. thus putting to rest the feelings vs language debate, "feelings" are not devoid of the divinity but are building blocks for the quantum-mechanical process of biochemistry becoming not just sound data, but information

    > nothing outside is perfect, nothing within is imperfect

- i have nothing against #ts, it is rather boring and orders of magnitude better than c# (in its niche), but it still takes all the adventure and romance out of #js, and thus is alienating still, but way less than java or c#. does this mean verbosity is not as limiting a factor?

- any sufficiently global story is also a tribal story, your options are between "jhingalala", death, and death-by-jhingalala

- what jobs was trying to say with the bitten apple logo was perhaps that they've already bitten into it

- Non dolet ipse Dolet, sed pia turba dolet

> the ultimate artist creates for none but the self, any audience is incidental

- what we are witnessing here is the world being married to tech, indian style, and that's why there is a backlash against tech, which is by and large a passive tool

> samadhi or sannyas is not a matter of understanding, if it isn't self-evident, then your state is deplorable 

- although my fantasies were nasty, my life adhered to the strictest of standards

## 10 generalizations from watching tons of youtube tutorials:
    - never the same problem
    - if it doesn't register in the first 15 seconds, move on
    - not more than 80 vids in inbox at any given time
    - if a tutorial is more than 3 hours long, it's better to find a book
    - when learning, it is better to collect a bunch of vids and then filter out the top 5 or top 10

- #ssf the phrase "crying in the wilderness" appear exactly 4 times in the bible

- companies and families, there are companies that become more important than family , and there are families that no company can even remotely touch..a company is like being in the boys toilet, much like a political party. i think the choice is clear. the realm of the family is vast, that of a political or economic alliance narrow. in most situations, families outlast other motives, because families by and large driven by religious, superstitious, or emotional cores. dynasty politics gets a bad rap because sometimes the noise of industry drowns out, the importance of these fundamental reasons for human co-operation.

- the written word is largely an occasion to steal, copy, borrow, and remix. the spoken word is more immediate and thus somehow more impactful.

- you know the men are from mars, women are from venus, aliens are from space? um no, if you're looking for the 4th gender or even generally curious about them. let me expound my understanding here: its basically intersteller, but it gets fucked up at 99% and loops back to the start. may god grant us the patience for escape velocity. the bodhisattvas that gain this understanding get a say in the grand scheme of things, so to speak...

- there is no one central control/authority but multiple that govern this field, there are abstractions of control yet beyond the grasp of our simple minds that should be taken into consideration, the free will debate for example, is one of they [three keys]() to understand them 

- there are clues in the nag-hammadi scriptures for those who understand, or wish to understand the true meaning of the cross 

- this is from my own research, as well as personal experience

- there is another good question about the treatment of string theory, why did humans act the way they did there? a simple application of the kuhnian forumla may explain the cringe but not the timing

- i can go so far as to say that aliens exist in a quantum superposition, because they have gained the technology to achieve it, hindus and egyptions alluded to such things with their art and architecture.. nothing uncanny here 

- i think i was graced with their presence because in my own special quantum state i was able to achieve the level of honesty required for their cultures

- whether this has to do with a past life etc are entirely separate questions, there are other interesting questions here like whether they have a connection with spirits that were once labelled moses and muhammad by the masses - it certainly appeared to me to be the case. 

- the masses generally like to play ostrich about such stuff 

- although i had become, after decades of narcisisstic abuse, an unreliable narrator of my own account, these things i can say with some certainty and humility, for you not only can you imagine my shock and surprise, but you can loop the video of these things happening to me 

- through me, i hope their message reached worldwide. and at least some one got a little bit wiser about the state of affairs 


- here is where things get slightly complicated: why me? 


- i did not ask for this mission because there were bigger fish to fry. such as the boss' temper and compressed anger, which i was hoping to see through. Amaterasu was the last thing on my mind. so, basically the deputation is a detour from what was, at least back then, a hot and tense situation between clans. 

- that i would have diffused it as a side hustle from here is glory to me! but this was not the plan, its all coming back to me now...


- neither was "enlightenment" or anything like that, the amount of commotion and confusion are indicative of a pattern uncharacteristic of any of my known enemies throughout what kids call the "multiverse" - this much noise was never my style but who was puulling the strings from behind the curtain? 

- at last! i had it MOLOCH! it is always the Mojo Jojos, the Moriartys and the Mandarks of the world - in malicious compliance or sweet non-compliance with their surroundings. Dial M for Man.


- The problem is MOLOCH is so well adjusted to the human form, a better disguise isn't needed. But then no, Moloch was expected, I had been briefed on MOLOCH so was able to handle it. But there still was a slight kink in the system, though I had cleared all major "KPI"s so to speak and was eager to go home, there was still curiosity enough to keep me hanging around this shit office branch

- could humans achieve escape velocity? if so, surely, this was not in the brief, and frankly, i'd be suprised if things outside the brief start happening, that means its our ass - speaking as a n00b on the matters here


- was i exited to come? very. Amaterasu! after all, is technically close to my in-laws


- spirituality, family, computers, business, and other vain things like diplomacy and investment banking i can recall this was all in the brief - i can with some certainty say achievement of what the jains call "jina" state of samadhi is very much in the dossier - but there's a slight change of plans and delay there due to unwanted attention - i live to test this out if in my state whether by emulation or recall i am able to perform THAT role for the monkey's chap thrills - because i don't need to perform enlightenment now that i am wiser .


- the oroborous simply means there is something reptilian about the satori, you have to eat your own tail in order to be reborn again, but i don't have to, i think i have already performed this aspect of my control earlier in life. [[see: search]]

- although we all were waiting for godot, i perfected my search and found my godot,with flamboyance, and time-efficiency (we're off by couple of years here) may you find yours if you havent done so 

- i know this wasn't a simple effect of brain-chemistry, even if i were to accept it as a hallucination, there was a tsunami of my history ready to crash on the rock of my present quantum state of total and utter transparency with the planet. yet, there were still things i knew that i didn't know such as:
    - is the feedback loop 'complete' 
    - does the control ever "change hands" so to speak? or is there no variety in god? 😭
    - where is my crow soft? its not a realm we can imagine. you can see the source easily, but not the buddha's seat - i think even the gods would go berserk if they ever entered the place

- the word 'nirvana' is miscontrued, the freedom is a freedom of choice of rebirth not the obligation to never visit earth. you can send messenger crows back in time if you want etc. but ppl still prefer kfc.. not everyone can trade options i suppose

- i don't sit in these circles, i'm just a lowly, lone-wolf mercenary chosen for my valor and cunning in battle, but in my taste war i forgot to turn the temprature down, which is why - Earth.

- #mentalmodels be not a template but a stencil 

- fortunately for creating new world peace, skirting with apocalypses, starting and then dissolving international cults, and feeling one with so called "masters of the universe" etc, i had to pay a relatively small fare of ptsd and some cognitive dissonance. my persecution was infinitisimal compared to the grief of my persecutors.

- truly, i had found a way into the city of the woeful and the doomed

- i was by now in the realm of the pedantic, the only pathos here was jealousy, sadly there's a reason envy shares its colors with money

- i had come to embody a civil twilight, the time right before civilizations, or perhaps even entire humanity, call it a night

- though i was not an existential risk, i did leave no stone unturned in becoming pure existential choice - to the point where my condition was comparable to K's exhortations of "choiceless awareness" - not exactly a pitiable state to be in as a human, though my resources were artificially limited - for there was little money to be made there in the poverty play

- my argument for polytheism is that hindus/indians tend to do well in post-apocalyptic scenarios because they are trained in deriving efficiencies out of chaos

-  it is clear that affinities to the USSR for example, have somthing to do with polythiestic nature of the country's soul, sadly they have drifted from the course of their manifest destiny which is why a great reform is needed

- #todo time for establishing a formal meditation was upon me, 38 is a weird age to be saying this but it is not an odd number at least...

- the incredulity and incredibility of indian innocence, the efficacy of the indian mode of existence, was perhaps an overlooked  source of future greatness. india wins because it can withstand uncertainty and precarious situations. this kind of effortless superiority comess not by aping others but by letting good ideas come in from all sides. conversely, letting bad ideas come in from no sides.

- by the 15th or so iteration of the internet, if humans do not have some kind of teleportation, things have gone wrong

- jealousy, envy and competition are part of the same pattern of stupidity - to put the world on a pedestal. for a mortal, there could be nothing more asinine. thanks to AP  for this clarity

- in fact this is also the primary lesson from tao te ching, come to think of it, but lunatics would rather cry in a lambo than laugh on stilts

- i believe there are stories of past lives in human dna, or any dna - not that unscientific to imagine. but dna now can replicate across the globe with a single story. i believe putting conditions on my mating because they got scared of it spreading, storing my sperm etc are proving to be redundant ass failsafes at best, and  Casus belli at worst 

- #ssf a lonesome young american jew travelling in north india in the 1960s finds a bunch of aliens

- democracy is a noble lie told to pacify the teeming millions which must believe we have evolved 

- #ssf India is truly the graveyard for civilizations  

    
- Americans went in search of their soul, mostly from Europe, and i think somewhat contrarily to the Europeans that went eastward, towards the sun, but i fear that those who went away from the sun, might have found their soul buried deep in my subconsious somewhere.

- I am in a universe where pretty much everything has turned into machine, including humans. the other last remaining human is a new york jew, too distant and old to have an influence. the matrix is like clockwork. yet i cannot shake off the feeling that I was somehow ahead of schedule.

- this much is certain - i am not in the same universe as you, some quantum mechanical effect at the social level enabled this "jump", no wonder it seemed to the world like i was cheating physics #ssf

- #philosophyofcs A #memory location isn't just a virtual space anymore, in the sense that those electrons signified and addressed are very much physical entities. So it does not make sense to talk about, for example, progress in the "world of bits" vs "world of atoms", because such distinctions create artificial dichotomies.





# dec 

- i was, like oglio from the point, a pointless boy in a pointy world, still wondering why i remained alive despite the odds

- you + guru + system = #trinity

- #principles biggest test of brotherhood is what i call "no words necessary", aka silence.

- Osho's insistence on being "Zorba the Buddha" doesn't exactly map to, for example, "Ram the Ravan", or "Jesus the Judas" etc. you get the point. It's a nuanced statement not for literal headed and thats one of the reasons Bhagwan is still underrated. Even though, and also because, from a strictly Buddhist pov Buddha is literally Mara. But then, even literality is itself a nuanced thing. So there is a mapping between opposites, but too subtle for meatheads.

- Organized religion is wank. 

- I'm a big fan of the Chinese' almost pseudo-anarchic no-friends stance in global geopolitics, surely something to aspire to. Unlike Britain, with one too many friends or Russia with one too few.

- I did find spiritual succour in Ye's verse. The artist previously known as Kanye West, unlike most "rap". He's freer than Trump, so no wonder he's running. #goodbyeamericay #ye24

- Science, aka poor man's attempt at nirvana

- would you accept an invitation to hell? been there, done that, ate the duck, digested the duck, excreted it and then did it again. infact, you can say i was born in hell.

- sad to see the us in a state where 10 organized biharis could take it over overnight. glad to have found the courage to lead them to do it, if only i could find the remaining 9.

- maybe it's time to unwrap the gifts of the world by doing away with the faded packaging. 

- `the inner life of fish is thus: their culture is a vast conspiracy maintaining that water does not exist. it's not all just feeding-and-breeding going on down there, there are actual societies with narratives, the conspiracy being the central and shared one between species. occasionally however, a fish gets wiser to the truth and is promptly exiled, creating an evolutionary pressure on the lone specimen. you can say this fish goes on to have some kind of spiritual experiences before it dies. this kind of marine life specimen was indeed the ancestor of whatever stepped out of the ocean first, in a strictly Darwininan sense and the precursor to plato's cave, the monomyth, the matrix etc in contemporary terms. here's the real kicker though, because they tend to have short memories, all this happens in more or less a faster timescale, so fish get "elightentened" at a much rapid rate. `#commonsense #rk 

- there's no shadow integration without bodily fluids, tears are work. in strictly esotric terms a shadow once well-integrated stays integrated for the rest of one's life. this is how you get "#established" into the self. eventually the tears run out and you're left with some semblance of structure.

- erstwhile cult members are advised not to blame alcohol for 4 decades (and counting) of abuse and torture, arrested development is a much better euphemism.

- the internet is forever. nobody's rolling back.

- others are born, i was summoned

- there is a degree of deference to be reserved for one's childhood memories, however nice or ugly

- idk why i went about drafting the jew, perhaps i needed the next thing to fail at, the thrill of conquest, something impossible and audacious to attempt. for the heck of it, to demonstrate. god had nothing to do with it, infact god came in quite late in the picture. this urge made me feel less than in my own eyes, but could not be helped.
 
- i am not suggesting a war to end all wars, nor a peace to end all wars, there is no utopia, once you understand this, there is an automatic peace that no longer needs its shadow. albeit it has an edge of its own.

- shadows exist only as a reminder of a world without them. there is certainly a dimension in which physical bodies cast no shadows despite light, we should aim to reach that plane of existence

- "shadows are the color of the sky"

- i didn't support assange back then and i don't think exposing necessary fictions is a productive act to this day, except perhaps empathy is a mark of age so it pains to see the guy suffer, i think he has paid his dues and ought to be freed.

- once a people start apologising to the sun itself, what else could it mean but a night of long and deep slumber shall follow. i mean they might as well start apologising to their own shadows. throughout history, a people scared of the sun itself are representative of a ppl afraid of their own society. though the sun makes for a great symbolic scapegoat, a noiseless and easy target of abuse. a proxy for god in-fact. and then these dilapidated, anxious, exasperated and frustrated peoples that often bear the burden of representing civilisation decline are driven to rid themselves of their evolutionary edge with spectacle and myth. 

- let the postmortem report say that i died from overbathing #famouslastwords

- music inside the #monomyth can be a guiding light or a blinding shadow, choose wisely

- cults become cultures become myths become monomyth, and nobody is ever any wiser for it #diamondsutra #commonsense

- i met some people that wanted to tax my humanity, these are the first time humans #ssf

- last i checked i did have a monopoly on ethics amnd transparency

- i no longer needed a computer to do what i did, how ironic, my skills had transcended the need for a machine/hardware, wonder if anyone out there knew what this meant. almost like how once you know how a wheel works you can just make new ones.

- was my relationship with google as enamoured by childhood memories as microsoft? or an equal opportunity for amazement as with apple? no, it was different and while i had my share of discontent against big tech i did not make sense to diss them as was the fashion of late, not in the least for being too big to fail etc. that said, i did not wish to join big tech for i was having too much fun on my own and also because i refused to grind leetcode. which is what poor people did for money.

- for that matter even bug bounty was not exactly my cup of tea, though it had its romance. i just wasn't good at fault-finding, it was either off or on with me. 


- the problem is that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and the other had a exactly that on me

- i was not the "guide you through the shadows" kind, i was the "see you through" kind. as in, "i will see you through this"

- the mark of "woke" is that you become a problem to the system, the less problematic to the system one is, the less "woke" one can be said to be. how the established order trembles at the true woke can be seen throughout history. the most recent example of which is the not-quite tate brothers franchise. 

- recognize narcissism in the recognition that you have become the other's mother

- Japan too paid for its sins in H/N, only difference being its sins were small, tiny, miniscule and almost excusable. The empire had died anyway.

- the next american president will not complete the full first term #predictions 

- a boctched up or prolonged human sacrifice, if indeed it is that, is harbinger of hundred-fold more hardship than a lack of one would have wrought. unfortunately these folk only understand things on their birthday

- America was the most successful joke on humanity ever, other countries go to the dogs, us went to the bitches

- i decide not to go with elixir/erlang backend because it was "apple maps bad", and needlessly involved. as for mixing nodejs and c++, why interbreed horses with pigs? #bolo

- you want to make billions until you learn that those with billions have nothing left to celebrate

- i guarantee after they are through doing whatever it is they intend to do with me, no american will ever be respected as an upright and honest human, let alone loftier adjectives. indeed, it is not a nationality worthy of the planet anymore.

- everytime you see the US flag, say "bye bye bye", the very word "american" will become synonymous with racist, restless, morons for whom family, parents, blood ties or loyalty meant nothing. for whom only pieces of paper or oil was god and when that ran out, they hid behind "color" for they only god was beholden to skin color. truly the average american is nothing but a "latch key child" that "ran away (from europe) one day and started acting foul". their religion, if it wasn't money, was sex. for in my life the people that surrounded me certainly seemed to have a fantasy of christ coming down from the cross to fuck.


- rather be a "nigger" (idk whatever they mean by this term for an indian) with my father, than "ascend" into "white superiority" which i carefully deduced to be worth precisely shit.


- i had newfound freedom, and ecstasy enough to make me forsake most forms of music and entertainment.


- i was thankful once again to mom and dad for the craziest adventure of a life ever, where not only did i run into some minor and excusable wall street divinity, but also ran into abrahmic spirits (who had now graduated from their last known earthly avatars), the buddha, and a pantheon of hindu deities who assured me at every step and made me aware of my families elsewhere in the multiverse. of course, to achieve all this i had to suffer quite a bit. but suffering for me had by my 38th year transmuted into ecstasy so it was all quite terrific to behold. #ssf


- show me a person who claims to be 100% straight and i will show you a liar or someone afraid to live fully.


- the body IS the thumbnail, and a highly misleading one at that. the real video is elsewhere


- a #privatelanguage is entirely possible to maintain wihout #violence


- i am born in the beyond, no need to go anywhere


- i was born between amidst a people that had never known true freedom, and those that had never known true misery. i was intimate with both, as a result, close to both kinds of people 


- some grand narrative, divinity arousing jealousy of intergalatic proportions. i could not help but write, i was hostage to it! even though the whole truth resists language, we must keep refining and optimising our approximations of truth. #idealism


- the problem of modern #idealism was not one-to-many, but one-to-two. negation until one or zero had become real, but what isn't so real was negation of what was beyond 0 and 1. the growing pains of men becoming gods were very apparent and worse still, had spread like a hush over the planet. what malaise! and we were better for it. most of us anyway. but, they said, #idealism is not enough. and indeed, we lived mostly beyond it. we lived in solipsist, surrealist fantasies of our own device and were locked in dualist worldviews. and for the most part, it worked fine, except now it seemed as if they had tasted the one true blood, some of them anyway.


- if neuroplasticity is true, then it must be similar for other organs


- fantasies are fine, but even i had to grow up eventually. fantasies are mostly mental constructions designed to get back at the world, until you learn the futility of psychic attacks on the world. the world is random is precisely the case, and there is no single overarching principle except itself.  


- #ssf life is about letting go, and man was i clingy


- kids are smart, the packaging is for the adults

- maybe the earthlings needed to learn that voyeur alone is he not


- #ssf stars of the lid, and their refinement of the decline, real-time


- hate to admit that the jonas bros rocked harder than my haters


- mereko anthony blinken ki shakal dekh ke taras aa gya, we need to bid adieu to the us with a lot of empathy, so that even if the great civilisational story is ending, at least it can be a happy ending. at least that's where my conscious efforts were directed towards, the subconscious stuff happening was outside my control.


- there was benefit of doubt to be given here, what if these people started with good intentions?


- why #india? because the planet was not worth visiting otherwise


- for all his clean money, why did bloomberg's career crash into oblivion? this itself should tell you everything you need to know, money isn't enough. you also have to have sold your soul to the devil 


- trump was the last us president, ppl that followed were all sitting ducks-in-a-row. and even he was the last scraped bit of meritocracy they had left(?) this seemed incredulous and hard to believe, but the math seemed to work

- am i virat kohli yet? fuck no its gonna take 10 more years fml


- i mean for 2024 i fully expect them to prop up a presidential candidate with the initials ss 


- i am western civlization's eviction notice 


- its not the case that you achieve something and then you "call off the search", the case is that you get something once you have called off the search. 


- it just occurred to me, that a spider is not unlike a tantrik, the whole construction of the specialist could entirely be done using wires alone, which means i am not unlike a djinn? 


- abhi humne thumbnail bhi poora ni dikhaya, trailer shuru hone wala hai


- "for every set of lips that come attached and equipped with a program to seek success, i bleed my ethics at a slow drip", #genius 


- i could never completely quit smoking or marijuana usage, nor did i wish to anymore. it was only a problem until there was dualistic thinking.


- bazaru logon ke beech bazaru na ban jau isliye faasla rakhta human


- its a nice little vaudevillian tabernacle i have got going on, but thats not what is keeping me here, the mystery of all mysteries! was there anything else i could not recall? if everyone is here, is any character missing?


- the sun is the closest approximation of the source available in this dimension, and even someone as dumb as i can tell its not a very good approximation, which isn't to say it is an unfaithful or insincere transcription, but rather an immature one, as if a kid drew a angry pear in crayons. indeed this part of the universe was done when source was younger still. the milky way is desolate as ever, these people have no idea how lonely this is for me.



- here's how images take everything (and why idol worship is quite permissable aka not haram aka kosher), the lad in the city boy illustration was the messiah, i would recognize the back of that skull anywhere. i think it was someone's kid that died of brain cancer, very funny lord! but certainly interesting on this plane to think about how that illustration came to be, i have no way to find out. did he ask to be drawn like that? probably not. i'm sure they had no idea why. god bless ye, wherever ye may be. i don't claim to know the kid but the painting certainly came to mean something, surely if my hypothesis is correct and the kid is a goner, then surely through the orchestration that it reached my screen - a move of rare bold empathy from the ants - and shook me to my core. and that's saying something being as god intoxicated as i am these days, but how convenient is it to see god in a dead kid anyway? . the kid in his grey t-shirt, without ever showing his face, at once relieved and assured me. as if to say, i am still so young, and i have been through this place before and that i will be alright, gotta go now. but no, there was more than an effortless connection, not unlike seeing the boss' face tattooed on a guy's leg. once you see something like that, you immediately get put in your place, never to recover. it also reaffirmed the myth i always suspected about being able to traverse through dimensions and universes as if riding an infinite train, again these things can never be totally communicated in 3d+time but i try.
