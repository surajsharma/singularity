- kaliyug has looped on itself, what a time to be alive!

- i'm going to bury capitalism deeper, for cheaper

- they fed me shit and this eventually led to asexual, abiological modes of reproduction, some sort of psychosomatic virgin births

- 2023: the year of radical focus

- aren't ya'll lucky my middle name is d not r

`shayad in logo ke liye koi jaadu tona tha ya ho gya, westerners are always looking to find magic in india and they often do

- right there, smack in the middle of the strange, the bizzare, and the uncanny and surreal! and yet, it was hardly weird or surprising, ancient businness as usual on an ancient planet

- i wouldn't be able to achieve what i did without somone shoving the whole 9 inches of L up my ass

- nazar teri buri burka main pehnu?

- on kashmir: today there are more, better ways to interfere with fully capable democracies than over territorial issues and identities, i offer my subjectivity as a theater of infinite war and infinte corruption, and i'm able to do this without selling my soul - what's to fear? but still, i insist on "if it ain't broken don't fix it" as a credo.

- on relationships: i discovered i owed 3 kinds of loyalty to 3 kinds of people, one was personal kind i owed to republicans, which implied fighting in public but loving in personal affairs, the other, the inversion of this loyalty was a very public one, which implied loving in public but fighting in private, how utterly fucked i was, and this was completely a mechanical reaction of sorts, i didn't exactly set out to find people to owe my life to. it wasn't the case that anything was for "pretend" here, just as things stood. then there were those i owe a nonexistent kind of loyalty to, these ppl were largely mediators of sort but brokering a peaceful solution was hardly their headache, unless they got something out of it, which made them dangerous because in the event of any untoward happenning they lacked the kind of cover rich ppl had. the way greed works if you are hypnotized first by the lure of the golden deer, my advice to these ppl was still to not chase a mirage. of course, i am not aware of half of the story, so it may be the case that i owed them in a 33-33-33% ratio structure, or some other distribution. this is if i'm keeping emotions aside, with emotions, the story was different, then, instead of a distribution there is an absolute hierarchy.


- what is a brahmin if not someone who puts the other to work for his own gain? a brahmin is like a constantine who excels in taking his demons to disneyland and then leaving them there

- as i continued waking up, the ptsd started to melt into what i could only describe as love, AND HOW!

- the way "dependent origination" works is, revealed knowledge leads to more revealed knowledge

- revealed knowledge can only be tested, not talked about

- these people wanted my dad, not knowing who he truly was, not knowing, his were the wrong set of tear ducts to activate

- liliputians study me as if they can understand by sex or studying alone

- sometimes i really wonder if they spent all this money just to teach me a lesson or if they really wanted to eat shit behind curtains

- to the corrupt indian IAS lobby pulling liliputian strings i have both middle fingers up and i say "saki thodi aur pila ki kuch nasha utre"

- IAS has become synonymous with corruption, hence the fake attempts and foreplay with power, and not the good kind of corrption either,  the insidious, institutional kind that can turn a hindu into a muslim, and a secular country to a muslim country real quick.. making independence a relatively short tryst with destiny. the aap/kejriwal moat/stronghold against it was fast becoming a last man standing personality cult, despite experiments with fresh leadership.. curious to see if the bathwater ends up with the baby

- i have reasons to believe my family had relations with the americans since at least the time of independence

- the "committee for the liberation of iran" shall have to taste defeat after defeat until it dissolves in my cult here and die as a open govt secret with my body

- and yes, no sooner did i start war prep these flatlanders started killing russians on indian territory.. a good christian ("putin critic" and a successful businessman in russia at the same time?).. flatlanders will try to strain any good relation they see because they cant stand it.. they cannot tolerate the world coming together as one for any reason, let alone political ones

- i'm not a crap jesus, he is a backward suraj

- acche din bol ke nahi laye jaate, chupke se smuggle kiye jaate hain

- the world turns on a dime, i can hardly despair

- i poured myself out in a world where people have trouble letting go

- how to identify a flatlander
    - hurts more on seeing another's happiness than from their own misery
    - show off / ostentatious / verbose / narcissistic
    - talks about name/place/animal/thing more than ideas
    - asserts undue dominance / entitled behaviour
    - travels in a group / scared to be (or do stuff) alone
    - engages in one-upmanship
    - fundamentally ungrateful, "self-made" illusions
    
    
 - what has your love got to hide? 
 
 - a brahmin is one who can recall each one of his lifetimes with grand precision
 
 - ladkiyon ko kon naukri nahi deta? so i yelled for the boys
 
 -  but you know its true, too much porn and masaturbation will effectively turn you off towards real beauty, i saw beauty afresh with my new eyes
 
 - haggling is the essence of old money
 
 - did i just turn abnother profit over some more bullshit? is it really a one-up on wall-street? is this time truly different? are you kidding me?
 
 - we didn't want to be the good guys
 
 - the fact that i'm actually getting money still, effectively dissolves the cult, just a lot of wannabes and half-way crooks who took pity but only for the time being
 
 
 - ceaseless commerce with the earth
 
 
 - i owe gratitude, not shame
 

 - my life got turned upside down again as if it were possible, they were starting to talk about a new name for a generation, but like everything, it seemed faked and rehearsed, my tolerance for bullshit had increased
 
 
 - "surely, not all turnip hunters are joker collectors"
 
 
 - had i managed to pull off an orson welles level farce/hoax?
 


 - on being successful: omg just listen to tony robbins, you get very good results for flawless work, good for very good, nothing below that, the same applies to the inner world


 
 - do i really need the money? this could all still be just a scam and we could still be little better than destitutes for all i know, so, i decided to oblige and let the stupid play continue
 


 - that there were religious connotations to my life, which the mob waas basically trying to erase - that this happenned is a fact, the luck was in the knowledge that religious sentiments are pretty cheap
 


 - i cannot believe it has been nearly 40 years of me suggesting absolutely moronic shit and these guys implementing it as tech
 


 - people are born, i was summoned, but nobody could say why because they could not admit the why
 
 
 - insaan ko apni misery bhaut hi pyari hai, hence the commotion, people are so in love with what ails them, it's like they are all crucified on it, so was i .. it wasn't the case that i didn't know any better, rather was in some sense wedded to it, some kind of comfortable numbness that kept the world at bay. so when it was finally taken away, and the world rushed in, it was like a cold and nervous un-blanketing, a kind of quick peeling away of one layer of reality, to be replaced simultaneously by another later, which they insisted was their truth. the moral and material effects of this unsheathing didn't last for long, i did however see the world with new eyes, but it was no better or worse than the reality i already knew, just different. having seen all this, i proceeded in a clinical manner to detach myself from strong attachments. in this regard, relationships were the hardest, not drugs or sex as most would assume.
