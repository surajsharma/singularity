1) The sheer amount of grit I have for sticking with a particular problem allows me to explore technology beyond most "engineers" out there. As a result, I am able to take the prevalent cutting edge and fit it into bleeding edge. Creating innovations at scale and pace.
2) My unique background allows for fresh, domain-agnostic perspective. The "freshness" of perspective cannot be summed up by the diversity factor alone. But certainly have a unique way of programming, debugging, and tooling that pushes the boundaries and raises the occassional exasperated puritan eyebrow.
3) My experiences in media and content strategy allow me to communicate more clearly and explicitly about than anyone I have come across, something perhaps you have already guaged from these points. These experiences also give me a better handle to understand any business and business model.
4) High emotional quotient and spiritual quotient allow me to gel well with international teams and ship without friction or politics.
