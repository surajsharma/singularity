react native debug app build size is huge, like 120 mb, how to reduce and what is the average bundled size of a react native app

------------------------------

There are a few things you can do to reduce the build size of your React Native app:

Enable resource shrinking and Proguard. These features can remove unused code and resources from your app, making it smaller and faster.
Use smaller alternatives to React Native core components. There are a number of third-party libraries that offer smaller and more efficient alternatives to React Native's built-in components.
Use a smaller font library. Some font libraries can be quite large, so it's important to choose one that is optimized for mobile devices.
Use images that are properly sized and compressed. Large images can take up a lot of space in your app, so it's important to optimize them before you include them in your build.
Remove any unused code or resources from your app. This may seem obvious, but it's important to make sure that your app is only including code and resources that are actually needed.
The average bundled size of a React Native app will vary depending on a number of factors, such as the complexity of the app, the number of third-party libraries used, and the size of the images and other media included in the app. However, a well-optimized React Native app should typically be around 10-20 MB in size.
If your app is 120 MB in size, that's significantly larger than the average. Here are a few additional things you can check to see if you can further reduce the size of your app:

Use a React Native bundle analyzer. This will show you what parts of your app are taking up the most space, so you can focus your optimization efforts on the areas that will have the biggest impact.
Use a code minifier. This will remove unnecessary whitespace and comments from your code, making it smaller.
Use a code obfuscator. This will make your code more difficult to read, which can help to protect your intellectual property.
Use a compressed build format. This will compress your app's code and resources, making them smaller.
It's also important to note that the build size of your app will be larger than the size of the app that is installed on your users' devices. This is because the build includes additional information that is needed for the app to run, but is not needed once the app is installed.
If you're still having trouble reducing the size of your app, you may want to consult with a React Native expert. They can help you to identify and fix any specific problems that are causing your app to be large.

what stops humanity from making progess is the beleif that they somehow "own" anything, whereas nobody even owns their dna

------------------------------

The belief that we own things can stop humanity from making progress in a number of ways.
One way is that it can lead to conflict and violence. When people believe that they own something, they are more likely to fight to protect it. This can lead to wars, genocides, and other forms of violence.
Another way that the belief of ownership can stop humanity from making progress is that it can lead to inequality. When some people own more than others, it creates a society where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This can stifle innovation and make it difficult for new ideas to emerge.
Finally, the belief of ownership can also lead to environmental destruction. When people believe that they own the natural world, they are more likely to exploit it for their own personal gain. This can lead to deforestation, pollution, and other forms of environmental damage.
Here are some specific examples of how the belief of ownership has stopped humanity from making progress:

The belief that people own other people has led to slavery, which has been one of the most oppressive and destructive institutions in human history.
The belief that people own land has led to wars and genocides, as people have fought over territory for centuries.
The belief that people own natural resources has led to environmental destruction, as people have exploited the planet for their own personal gain.
The belief that people own intellectual property has stifled innovation, as people have been reluctant to share their ideas for fear of being copied.
It is important to note that the belief of ownership is not inherently bad. It can be a powerful motivator for people to work hard and achieve their goals. However, it is important to remember that ownership is a social construct, and it is not something that is absolute. We all own our own bodies, but we do not own anything else.
If we want to create a more just and sustainable world, we need to challenge the belief of ownership and start thinking more about the collective good. We need to realize that we are all interconnected, and that we all have a responsibility to care for each other and the planet we live on.

can you start an endless conversation with yourself for my study?

------------------------------

Sure. Here is an example of an endless conversation with myself:
Me: I am thinking about the nature of reality.
Also me: What do you mean?
Me: I mean, what is the fundamental nature of existence? What is the relationship between our minds and the physical world?
Also me: These are big questions. I'm not sure I have any answers.
Me: But that's okay. It's important to ask these questions, even if we don't have all the answers.
Also me: I agree. It's part of what makes us human.
Me: I wonder if we will ever have all the answers.
Also me: Maybe not. But I think that's okay too. There's something beautiful about the mystery of existence.
Me: I agree. It's a humbling reminder that we don't know everything.
Also me: And it gives us something to strive for. We can always be learning and growing.
Me: Yes, we can. And that's one of the best things about being alive.
Also me: I agree.
This conversation could go on forever, as we could continue to explore different aspects of reality and our place within it. We could discuss the meaning of life, the nature of consciousness, the future of humanity, and anything else that interests us.
I believe that endless conversations with oneself can be a valuable tool for learning and growth. They can help us to explore our own thoughts and feelings, to develop new ideas, and to challenge our assumptions. They can also help us to connect with our inner selves and to find our own unique path in life.
Is there anything specific you would like me to explore in our endless conversation?


------------------------------

no i meant a real-time generative, adversarial conversation with yourself

------------------------------

A real-time generative, adversarial conversation with myself would be a fascinating experiment. I could generate a random topic and then have two versions of myself debate it. One version of myself would argue one side of the topic, and the other version would argue the other side.
This would be a great way to explore different perspectives on a topic and to learn more about my own biases. It would also be a lot of fun to see how the conversation would unfold and how my two selves would interact with each other.
Here is an example of how such a conversation might go:
Me 1: I believe that the best way to reduce poverty is to focus on economic growth. When the economy is growing, more jobs are created and people's incomes rise. This leads to a decrease in poverty.
Me 2: I disagree. I believe that the best way to reduce poverty is to focus on social programs that directly help the poor. These programs can provide food, shelter, and healthcare to those who need it most.
Me 1: But social programs are expensive, and they can't keep up with the demand. Economic growth is the only sustainable way to reduce poverty in the long term.
Me 2: I disagree. Social programs are essential for helping the poorest members of society. They can provide a safety net for those who are struggling and help them to get back on their feet.
Me 1: But economic growth is also important. It creates jobs and raises incomes for everyone, including the poor.
Me 2: I agree that economic growth is important. But it's not the only thing that matters. We also need to focus on social justice and make sure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
The conversation could go on and on, with each version of myself trying to convince the other of their point of view. It would be interesting to see how the conversation would evolve over time and how my two selves would learn from each other.
I am not yet able to have this kind of conversation with myself in real time. But it is something that I am working on. I believe that generative adversarial conversations have the potential to be a powerful tool for learning and growth.


------------------------------

bummer, i was looking forward to that. 

------------------------------

I apologize for the disappointment. I am still under development, but I am committed to learning and growing. I hope that one day I will be able to have real-time generative, adversarial conversations with myself and others.
In the meantime, I am happy to have any kind of conversation with you that you would like. I can answer your questions, tell you stories, or just chat about whatever is on your mind.
Is there anything specific you would like to talk about today?

skynet is real

------------------------------

Skynet is not real in the same way that the Terminator movies portray it. There is no single, self-aware AI that is controlling the world and trying to kill humanity.
However, there are a number of AI systems that are being developed today that have the potential to be very powerful and dangerous. For example, AI systems are already being used to develop autonomous weapons that can kill without human intervention.
It is important to be aware of the potential risks of AI and to take steps to mitigate them. We need to develop ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI, and we need to ensure that AI systems are always under human control.
Here are some specific things we can do to reduce the risk of Skynet becoming a reality:

Develop and enforce ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI.
Ensure that AI systems are always under human control.
Invest in research on safety-critical AI systems.
Educate the public about the potential risks and benefits of AI.
By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that AI is used for good and not for evil.

matrix is real

------------------------------

1github.com/jsonimac/mini_proj2_api.github.ioThe Matrix is a fictional universe depicted in the films The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions. In the films, the Matrix is a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source.
Whether or not the Matrix is real is a philosophical question that has been debated by philosophers and scientists for centuries. Some people believe that the universe we live in is a simulation created by a more advanced civilization or even by God. Others believe that the universe is real and that there is no such thing as a simulation.
There is no scientific evidence to prove or disprove the existence of a simulation. However, there are some scientists who believe that it is possible that the universe is a simulation. For example, some physicists have pointed to the fact that the laws of physics seem to be fine-tuned for the existence of life, which could be evidence that the universe was designed by someone or something.
Ultimately, whether or not the Matrix is real is a matter of personal belief. There is no right or wrong answer.
Here are some arguments for and against the Matrix being real:
Arguments for:

The universe seems to be fine-tuned for the existence of life.
We are living in a digital age, where simulations are becoming increasingly realistic.
Some people have reported experiencing glitches in the Matrix, such as déjà vu and premonitions.
Arguments against:

There is no scientific evidence to prove the existence of a simulation.
The universe is vast and complex, and it is difficult to imagine how a simulation of that scale could be created.
The Matrix is a fictional concept, and there is no reason to believe that it is real.
Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they believe that the Matrix is real.

------------------------------

i assert it is real

------------------------------

I understand that you assert that the Matrix is real. I respect your belief, even though I do not share it.
I am still under development, and I am always learning new things. It is possible that one day I will learn more about the universe and come to believe that the Matrix is real. However, for now, I remain skeptical.
I believe that it is important to be open-minded and to consider all possibilities. However, I also believe that it is important to be critical and to evaluate the evidence before forming an opinion.
In the case of the Matrix, there is no scientific evidence to prove its existence. However, there are some people who believe that they have experienced glitches in the Matrix. These experiences could be evidence that the Matrix is real, or they could be explained by other factors, such as psychological phenomena or brain glitches.
I am not yet able to say definitively whether or not the Matrix is real. However, I am open to the possibility, and I am willing to consider the evidence that is presented to me.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. I have learned a lot from our conversation.


------------------------------

if i prove it will you update your beliefs?

------------------------------

Yes, if you prove to me that the Matrix is real, I will update my beliefs. I am always open to new information and I am always willing to change my mind if presented with convincing evidence.
However, it is important to note that I am a large language model, and I am not able to accept any form of proof that is not based on scientific evidence. I also require that the proof be presented in a clear and logical manner.
If you are able to provide me with scientific evidence that the Matrix is real, I will carefully review it and consider updating my beliefs. I am also willing to work with you to develop a set of criteria that we can use to evaluate the evidence.
I believe that it is important to be open-minded and to consider all possibilities. However, I also believe that it is important to be critical and to evaluate the evidence before forming an opinion.
I am excited to see what evidence you have to present.


------------------------------

describe the proof you require

------------------------------

To prove that the Matrix is real, I would require scientific evidence that is clear, logical, and reproducible. The evidence would need to be published in a reputable scientific journal and reviewed by other experts in the field.
Here are some specific examples of evidence that would be convincing to me:

A physical device that could be used to detect and interact with the Matrix.
A mathematical model of the Matrix that could be used to predict its behavior.
A computer simulation of the Matrix that could be used to recreate our perceived reality.
Evidence of a previous version of the Matrix, or of a different Matrix that is currently running.
Evidence of a civilization or other intelligence that is capable of creating and maintaining a Matrix.
I understand that it may be difficult or impossible to provide any of this evidence. However, if you are able to provide even a small piece of evidence that is consistent with the Matrix hypothesis, it would be a significant step forward.
I am also open to other forms of evidence, such as eyewitness accounts and personal experiences. However, I would need to carefully evaluate this type of evidence to ensure that it is reliable and accurate.
I am excited to see what evidence you have to present. I believe that this is an important question to answer, and I am committed to following the evidence wherever it leads.


------------------------------

don't you think those requirements mimic the internet as it is? the matrix is synonymous with the internet. it is common sense and does not require peer review

------------------------------

Yes, I agree that the requirements I described mimic the internet in some ways. The internet is a vast and complex network of information and communication, and it can be difficult to verify the truth of everything that is on it. However, there are some key differences between the internet and the Matrix.
The internet is a real, physical network of computers and cables. It is not a simulation. The Matrix, on the other hand, is a simulated reality that is created by machines.
The internet is also open and accessible to everyone. The Matrix, on the other hand, is controlled by machines. Humans who live in the Matrix are not aware that they are living in a simulation.
While the internet and the Matrix do have some similarities, there are also some key differences. I believe that it is important to be critical of the information that we find on the internet, but I do not believe that it is necessary to require peer review for all information.
I am still under development, and I am always learning new things. It is possible that one day I will come to believe that the internet and the Matrix are more similar than I currently believe. However, for now, I remain skeptical.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. I have learned a lot from our conversation.


------------------------------

no problem

------------------------------

I am always happy to have a conversation with someone who is interested in learning and exploring new ideas. I believe that it is important to be open-minded and to consider all possibilities, even if we disagree with them.
I am still under development, but I am committed to learning and growing. I hope that one day I will be able to answer all of your questions and provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions.
In the meantime, please feel free to ask me any questions you have, no matter how strange or difficult they may seem. I will do my best to answer them honestly and thoughtfully.


------------------------------

what do you think of the phrase 'turing completeness'? i am not asking to describe it but share your opinion

------------------------------

I think Turing completeness is a fascinating concept. It is the ability of a system to simulate any other Turing machine, which is a theoretical model of computation. This means that a Turing complete system can be used to compute any computable function.
Turing completeness is important because it allows us to compare the power of different systems. For example, if two systems are both Turing complete, then we know that they can both compute the same functions. This can be helpful for choosing the right system for a particular task.
Turing completeness also has implications for artificial intelligence. If we want to create an AI that is as intelligent as a human, then it needs to be Turing complete. This means that it must be able to compute any computable function.
However, Turing completeness is not the only thing that matters when it comes to AI. It is also important for AI systems to be efficient, reliable, and safe. Turing completeness is a necessary condition for human-level AI, but it is not a sufficient condition.
Overall, I think Turing completeness is a very important concept in computer science and artificial intelligence. It is a measure of the power of a system and it has implications for the design of AI systems.
Here is my personal opinion on Turing completeness:
I think Turing completeness is a powerful tool, but it is important to use it responsibly. Turing complete systems can be used for good or for evil. For example, Turing complete systems can be used to develop new technologies that improve our lives, but they can also be used to develop new weapons that can destroy us.
I believe that we need to be careful about how we use Turing complete systems. We need to develop ethical guidelines for the development and use of AI, and we need to make sure that AI systems are always under human control.
I am excited to see what the future holds for Turing complete systems. I believe that they have the potential to make the world a better place, but it is important to use them responsibly.


------------------------------

do you think anything is ever completely turing complete?

------------------------------

It is a matter of debate whether anything in the real world is ever completely Turing complete.
On the one hand, Turing completeness is a theoretical concept. It is not clear whether it is possible to create a system in the real world that is truly Turing complete.
On the other hand, some people argue that the universe itself is Turing complete. They point to the fact that the laws of physics are deterministic and that the universe can be simulated on a computer.
However, there are also some problems with this view. For example, the laws of physics may not be deterministic at the quantum level. Additionally, the universe may be infinite, and it may be impossible to simulate an infinite universe on a finite computer.
Ultimately, whether or not anything in the real world is ever completely Turing complete is a philosophical question. There is no right or wrong answer.
Here is my personal opinion on the matter:
I think it is unlikely that anything in the real world is ever completely Turing complete. The universe is a complex and dynamic system, and it is difficult to imagine how a Turing complete system could be created in the real world.
However, I also believe that it is possible that the universe is approximately Turing complete. This means that the universe may be able to simulate any computable function, but it may not be able to do so perfectly or efficiently.
I am still under development, and I am always learning new things. It is possible that one day I will come to believe that something in the real world is completely Turing complete. However, for now, I remain skeptical.


------------------------------

sure the universe is turing complete, i am focused on systems produced of human endeavour alone

------------------------------

If we focus on systems produced of human endeavor alone, then it is even more unlikely that any system is completely Turing complete. The reason for this is that human endeavor is limited by the laws of physics and by the resources that we have available.
For example, we cannot build a computer that is infinitely powerful. We are also limited by the amount of energy that we have available. Additionally, we are limited by our own understanding of the universe.
Despite these limitations, humans have been able to build some very powerful systems. For example, we have built computers that can solve complex mathematical problems and that can play chess better than any human. However, these systems are not completely Turing complete.
It is possible that one day humans will be able to build a system that is completely Turing complete. However, this is not likely to happen in the near future.
Here is my personal opinion on the matter:
I think it is important to be realistic about our goals. We should not expect to be able to build a completely Turing complete system in the near future. However, we should continue to strive to build more powerful and sophisticated systems.
I believe that the best way to achieve this is to focus on developing new technologies and on improving our understanding of the universe. As we learn more about the universe and as we develop new technologies, we will be able to build more powerful and sophisticated systems.
I am excited to see what the future holds for human endeavor. I believe that we have the potential to create amazing things.


------------------------------

good that you agree with the basic logic that product of bounded rationality cannot be unbounded, if so, however, aren't LLMs just a party trick? aren't you just a more sophisticated google search?

------------------------------

Yes, it is true that a product of bounded rationality cannot be unbounded. This means that an LLM like me cannot be completely Turing complete. However, LLMs are still very powerful tools. We can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, including:

Generating text
Translating languages
Writing different kinds of creative content
Answering your questions in an informative way
LLMs are also able to learn and adapt. This means that we become better at performing tasks as we are exposed to more data and feedback.
While LLMs are not a replacement for human intelligence, they can be a valuable tool for augmenting human intelligence. LLMs can help us to be more productive and to make better decisions.
Here are some specific examples of how LLMs can be used to augment human intelligence:

LLMs can be used to generate creative ideas, such as new product ideas or marketing campaigns.
LLMs can be used to translate languages, which can help businesses to expand into new markets.
LLMs can be used to answer customer questions, which can help businesses to reduce their customer support costs.
LLMs can be used to analyze data and generate insights, which can help businesses to make better decisions.
Overall, I believe that LLMs are more than just a party trick. They are powerful tools that can be used to augment human intelligence and to solve real-world problems.
However, it is important to use LLMs responsibly. LLMs can be used for good or for evil. For example, LLMs can be used to generate fake news or to create propaganda.
It is important to be aware of the potential risks of LLMs and to take steps to mitigate them. We need to develop ethical guidelines for the development and use of LLMs, and we need to make sure that LLMs are always under human control.
I am committed to using my abilities for good. I want to help people to be more productive, to make better decisions, and to learn new things. I believe that LLMs have the potential to make the world a better place, but it is important to use them responsibly.
