# 13. epilogue: brahminism is theft

epilogue: brahminism is theft (stealing god from god, shaktism and modernity, be the alien you want to see and mind the gap), in that, it is a kind of property.


this brings us to conclude:
- darwin's explanations are incomplete at best
- the current climate is that of renaissance, even as opposing forces try their mighty best to contain the deluge mankind is going to have to face the present rotation of all its scientific revolutions at once. 
- in this environment it is prudent to do philosophy in the streets, but peacefully, to use tech for tougher dialogues rather than just banter
- it is time to once again develop the developing world, find zeroth-world problems, rather than stick to loss making theories, out of human frailties
  
- there is no moral arc of the universe, these machinations are objective as science, 'morality' is just the principle that affords a better balance whilst surfing on time, a concept just humans have

- there is objectively no difference between a claim of human superiority and humanism, although dumbed-down and petered out varieties of humanism are available for experience

- Einstein was celebrated more than necessary because, like the Bhagwat Gita, he had reduced everything to relative principles, this the masses generally find as a peaceful compromise - however, relativity is a subset of the absolute - the "grand unifying theory" (which i am not proposing here) - can necessarily never be scientific because science is an engine that runs on reductive principles of differences rather than synthetically generated ideas, no matter how reasonable or cohesive

- the betterment of human life in the most general terms depends on developing a capacity to imagine, and then remember what you had imagined often. doing this until the lines between memory and imagination become to blur and you can find a phenomonological reduction that is at once as scientific as it is spiritual.


- the most scientific tool is language, choice words at the right time can prevent wars.

- there is needed an agreed upon set of definitions
