- I was not always the tantrik Atmaram Dutt, just as Vishnu was not always Hari, but causal creases and tumult labelled us so. While Hari, who also suffered any number of ordeals on this miserly planet, found neither the time nor the inclination to pen down his journeys, I invariably find myself leaving opalescent trails behind, if only to trace through them later. 

- So, this time, I write after having gone stark raving mad and because my condition, I have reason to believe, might not outlast the lucidity needed to clearly tell the story. 

- From behind a thin, loose, shimmering, and multicolored veil of modern euphemisms for an ancient ennui, with such seductive, exotic, esoteric, psychological handles such as CPTSD, PTSD, schitzophrenia, narcissistic personality disorder, seasonal affective disorder, bipolar disorder, you name it - from behind this grave and pallid veneer I address and invite the reader in.

- Indeed a veil as piss-soaked and technicolor as Joseph's amazing coat, or was it a raincoat? I forget which, but my guess is it ought to have been a raincoat, if his journey was half the shitstorm mine is. I don't think there is a word in human psychology for what I have, let a alone a medicine, to say nothing of a cure.
  
- And I write because it has come to a point where I would give anything for actual, physical pain. An accident perhaps, or even a bout of irreason enough to give me a nudge off a balcony, turn me into a nice, folded splat of meat on the ground - if only it wasn't for the covenant, I would have ejected myself out by now.

- So yes, without wasting any time, there is a covenant, a mural, a crypt, a manuscript etc., the whole nine yards in my story, but let us begin at the very beginning, wherein I, much like the fabled ghost Betaal, sat meditating (albeit not upside down like our famished friend) in my comepletely virginal, virtual, recursively constituted cave located at the very center of the planet known in english as 'Saturn'.

-  Time out of mind, the sand started coming in. First with gentle, slienced sweeps of particles rolling over like tiny tumbleweeds along the sunroofed and cobblestoned courtyard I sat centered in. 
 
-  Then, like doubt turning into paranoid faith of a cockroach that wants to immolate itself under the light from the refrigerator door - it invited itself into the sanctum sanctorum in ever greater magnitude, frequency and force, its each grain shivering intentfully with a singular and oddly orchestrated volition that was saw-toothed, like the ring from a red rotary telephone, clandestine as a witch's knock on a poor brahmin's door some fateful and stormy night, urgent as thunder that follows the sound of its own arrival and sad as a damsel in a distress of galactic proportions, I watched it (from my mind's eye, since I was, after all, still in deep meditation) pour in and  arrange itself in melancholic, silent heaps around my cross-legged and motionless countenance - until my hallowed cave (and the temple within) were beset with it "as a lion's mane swarms with fleas".

-  Beginnings are heroism's only recompense. "No wonder", I remember thinking, "this must be yet another fruit of an ongoing meditation. Another iteration of maya to conquer in my never-ending journey". 

-  But beginnings are hard to sustain and soon enough, the entire surroundings started smelling of the seeds of decay, of that bend in the shadow world wherein entropy folds upon itself. It came from the birthplace of all evils that cannot be named in any of the N dimensions of the polyhedra known as Adwaita, but must be referred to by signifiers of pure negation. 

- From the ward of not, the constituency of never, the creche of no, the school of the negative, the college of sarcasm, the office of violence, and the retirement home of pure unadulterated pain. The lower half of difference itself, for those who can fathom, from far far far beyond Dante's 9th circle no doubt.

- Days turned to months, years to decades, centuries to millennias, the silica kept raining, pouring in with the dogged determination of a gold-digger trophy wife seeking a divorce. 
  
- By now I could  hear from deep within my meditation someone pleading for an insanity defense. Thus alerted to that presence which,  had no reason left to conclude wasn't benign, I I was triggered and had started leafing through my transcendental rolodex of known adversaries.

- Could it be the aghori Vibhatsanath, the one who, at every chance affored to him merges into my shadows and orbits my psyche only to crack open my skull for he seeks the jewel within it. Surely the hoax that had presented itself had elements of his mischief, but lacked the disciple, the orchestration, and sheer scale of the apparition. 

- It could also be the work of the demon Dil, who, in eons past had fought many battles with me, and unfortunately had never won a single one. Though the whole orchestration of the pouring sand seemed way out of character for the simple minded fool. 

- The next usual suspect was the rakshasa Binduma - accustomed as he was of keeping his distance, it did not deter him from crawling up my skin and feel my pulse every now and then, and could manifest as anything between a water boil to a long lasting malaise of natural or supernatural order. yet, the dark energy that surrounded me was oddly too feminine, so unless it was doing his bidding, I could not be sure.

- Of course, Binduma travels with his own retinue and chief among those was the pishacha named Teel ... warmer. Surely, the whole perverted orchestration bore his signature. It was stinky, loud, obnoxious, and disorienting. 

- It was a production alright, magic that could not be performed over distances greater than twelve light years, and I did not want to be a part of it, but it stuck to me like a lover scorned - coiled around me without a trace of self esteem, let alone self respect. This narrowed down my search for a solution quite a bit, and I started another journey within my meditation in search for an answer. 

- My doomed journey was of course, to start in the most likely of the places I could find the pishacha, planet Earth. And no sooner had I embarked upon it, the mountains of sand that had by now come to be a desert, started shifting and vibrating, arranging themselves into code and hieroglyphics I could not decipher. Surely, I had found a clue!

- But why earth? Why would Teel leave his rather idyllic abode on Neptune and give me such grief again? Three reasons. Firstly, the only place with sand in a twelve light-year radius is the planet Earth. secondly, his legend on earth is imprinted on the planet's history and he has sanctuary there, and lastly, the history of the planet finds a new lack in his presence, which he needs to fill - and who better than myself to fill it with? 

- The legend is the simple part, the pishacha is known by the earthlings as the snake, worshipped in some cultures, reviled in others, but present in all. 

- The history is where it gets complex, at least for earthlings.

- Now we, of the tantrik order know that every journey to the third planet is a destructive, negating, and horrible one. I would rather jump on the orbit to the Kuiper belt and get slapped by every passing rock than go to earth, and he knows it. Precisely choose it as a theater for this skirmish? Surely, the sand itself was a clue, perhaps a great upheaval was upon the humans. 

- Perhaps, yes, the humans had found a new mode of strife. Which made my journey all the more dangerous, both for me and the earthlings - to say nothing of Teel, who had invited his violent and gruesome death by my hands and mouth once again.

   But even with eyes three quarters shut and mind still as a citadel, I could see through its machinations. A face drawn in ripples on the bog that once was my only source of drinking water was gurning so obscenely at the sky that even the lonely waxing crescent seemed like it was trying to hide itself behind a veil of clouds and fireflies. 

   No wonder the feathered trinity perched on their designated spot on the bough of the Crape myrtle - that had erupted from underneath the ground before me on the moment of my first satori, and now stood as tall as a metaphysical souvenir after all these years at the edge of my pond -  had gone eerily silent as if trying to honor its presence.

   Had someone taken a liking to the quality of my silence?

   It didn't take long to understand this love letter from a parallel universe - it was designed to tempt, seduce, cheat, and eventually dupe - now shining like shards of powdered glass under the afternoon sun, now glistening like a termite on a pair of lips hovering threateningly over sand dunes, curved in a smile if only for the loo carrying them afloat. 

[With only wet whistles and dry whispers shared  between them, like a secret language of their own, these foot soldiers were, before i could realize it, dancing for decades in my old stone temple without completely disappearing.]

   For the first few years I entertained it yet another distraction, more evidence of my ever deepening samadhi was this seductive display of mara, but at the same time, I was measuring it, parsing it in all its granular glory, combing through its attitude, sizing it up while wishing it away.

   "I have a compulsion, dear sojourner", I felt like addressing the grains from my posture, "to discount cries seeking help and attention, I offer no duels here, go away.", but I didnt, and not on a singular occasion. For to indulge in power play with intergalatic stuff was not my intention.

   I just sat there, samadhi already half broken after thirteen years of this unwelcome distraction, chiding myself for not being able to recall this menacing stranger at my door.

   Even from my squint I could tell the script was not earthly, was any of this real? If indeed it was mara, should I break samadhi and indulge? Never, of course, so It there for a few more ages.

   As the years rolled by, so did the sand, arraging and rearranging itself into infinitely new shapes and faces and words all around me while the heiroglyphic manuscript on the pillars around us remained the same.

   Until one winter morning, when it's tired dance had slowed to a irritated stomping of the slurry that had resulted as a result of all the snow, when the feathered trinity had flown away and even the snow laden branches of Tulasidas - the only vegetation on my himalayan compound -  had melted, the sand made a symbol that jolted me right out of my frigid, meditative stupor.

    The symbol represented what is known in tantrik circles as the "shoulder surfer's loop". Somewhere out in the desert, underneath a leafless sandalwood tree stand two transfixed, emaciated and ancient looking naked beggars facing each other, perpetually sharing information through their eyes that glow with all the colors of myth and lore as they watch, transfixed, over the cirumferences of each other's ebony and ivory bowls, which are filled to the brim with a mercurial liquid reflecting the passing information. 
   
>   Green-eyed snakes hang from the tree's naked branches, occasionally dipping their forked tongues into their bowls (reflecting their original faces), making the beggars enter states of seizure and ecstasy, plasma shooting from their extremities like thunderbolts heralding the end of an epoch in some faraway galaxy. 
   
   From time to time, certain adventurers have tried to photograph or otherwise time the recurrence of such seizures, none have succeeded. 
   
   I was jolted because I recognized the symbol. It was, precisely, the logo of the now rather infamous Flying Snakes Insurance Company of New York. 

   I refrained from smashing my palm against my face. It was, I presumed, the work of my old gang. I finally opened my eyes fully and watched the sand dissolve into the thawing snow for the next few months until all I had left was a thoroughly wet cobblestoned courtyard, and my mind once again filling up with fond memories of past lives enjoyed.

"I mean there's no guarantee, i'm sorry"


"What the fuck are you on about? I thought this was an insurance company"


"Now, maybe you don't understand this entity that visited you, but even if you do, you have no clue how dangerous that place is, can't even get there in a single lifetime, you need.. attempts.., do you understand? hello! you've just been visited by hell and you want to go there?"


"listen, there are places even music starts to sound like a punishment, and i'm talking good prog rock here like Toad or something... to say nothing of the journey"


"oh please, my dear prog rock is already punishment enough"


"be that as it may, i would advise against any such adventure, besides, aren't you already way in over your head with the, uh, what have yous"


"huh i thought that debt was paid, i'm surprised at your hesitation"


"my reluctance is proportional to your curiosity, really are you that bored?"


"something fails to add up here"


"what?"


"i cannot recall it"


"man, fuck your nostalgia, this isn't.. this isn't a controlled stunt, you understand? this isn't one of your "music to rob goldman sachs to" playlists, this isn't one of your props, you stand to lose more than your priviledges here"


"alright alright, i hear your concerns, I guess I just got distracted for a bit there."


"you're damn right, i've been hearing how the price on your head doubles with each breath you take on this planet, why mess about stuff at the other end of the galaxy? aren't you worshipped by enough cultures here that you want to try to impress her?"


"it isn't about her, i guess i just got carried away with the spectacle of it all"


"precisely, you need to forget it. besides its personal, my business depends on you not knowing certain facts about it, and while i'm being honest, I would rather you didn't know them for your own good, if not mine."



... 

"what if i told you ... the thing wants to be proselytised? or at least it ought to be"


"you're thinking with your balls again!"

... 


That night, dreaming on the flight back..


"Tantrik, you've already been sacrificed at the altar of chance, why not indulge?"


"What could you offer me but more toes to step all over? More trains to drive over even more eggshells?"


"Pity"


"Indeed"


...


"How about a number? Your favourite one, make it yours and rule the world"


"Fascinating"


...


In the absence of something write home about, people will resort to lying..
