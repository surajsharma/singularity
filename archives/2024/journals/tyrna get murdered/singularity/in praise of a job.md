- So why is the Hitman franchise so difficult to play?, just think of all that go wrong in an assination.
Lets start with the assasin. As a keeper of the underworld, s/he follows a discipline. Discipleship brings with it the burden of that which brings it forth, wheather it is law, ideology, king, country, father, mother, or guru, the assasin is tied to their worldview to the point of forsaking rationality.  Add to this subjective biases, moods, health, weather and location-related contingencies. The chances of a rather even execution by anyone's standards is negligible.

- the tantrik's guru was a perpetually bald 6 year old advaitin who lived on the minute midnite train. a narrow guage toy engine oscillating perpendicular to the planet's axis, 35 empthy freight compartments in faithful tow. nobody ever saw his face for he never looked directly at anyone, but always met everyone with his back towards them as he sat dangling his legs from an open train door, looking at universe pass. once an attendant did chance upon suru brushing his scalp in a mirror, she could only describe it as "intense".

- suru used to say that if a individual ever invented something as important as fire again, they could not be rescued from or by modern society, rather they might end up persecuted. but two people are involved, it's probably a con. but if the inventors admit to be clowns, they may be spared some sympathy.

    - some say suru was an alien, others worshipped him. the tantrik bowed each time an audience was granted, but their chequered partnership had been beaten into submission by the powers and salad days were but a mirage on the asphalt.  

    - being on the minute midnute express felt like living in a levitating elevator so huge it has its own climate that felt about as pleasureable as an uncanny valley made somehow less uncanny.

- "waking up is expensive business, not everyone can afford, is this new damsel in distress worth it?" the monk half-expected him to say, "you must quit distractions and focus on your practice"?

- "the point is to run out of words for the world first", suru said instead.

- "do you have a word for the entity"?

- "it isn't random, nor is it unemotional, it's animated, like a sentient cartoon", the plea was certainly palpable and had the visciousness of counsciousness behind it

- "it could be a trap, you think?"

- or a  soitary canary, i mean you've got to give it marks for originality

- sure there's the style discussion, but i don't think you are ready for the hunt
