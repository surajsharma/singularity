The civilisation colonising the Upper South America was always an uncontrolled growth, but the last 60 years are indicative of its natural decline as a catalyst for human potential, it is time for a surgery.

A global mastectomy of sorts to ween off the people from this toxic teat of mother earth.

Letting it continue on borrowed time only worsens the disease, is a threat to not just global peace, but to existence itself.

It is fast running out of reasons to continue, including hatred out of which it was created. Unlike white ppl elsewhere (europe, russia, israel) this civilisation was born out of the need for privacy and now it goes around begging for it.

The symptoms make it a classic case.

It is becoming unstable of late, electing vaudevillian leaders and committing acts of international terrorism "unknowingly" putting both itself and the global democratic order at great risk,  spreading pandemics, withdrawing from established strategic outposts in an unjustifiable hurry, passing self-satirising legislation like the respect for marriage act, pranoid as ever, it is snooping on neighbours and geographically distant allies alike, testing arms grade tech on civilians of other countries (WHILE threatening them, obviousy) and all this in addition to the business as usual (corruption, racism, human rights abuse etc)  in this vaccum of a culture.

Its cultural decline, if one assumes it had any culture of its own (besides race), is something which, if one brings up in polite company, one starts sounding anachronistic immediately. A description of this decay I leave to the reader's imagination.

Its people fantasize turning into zombies, fighting over adjectives and pronouns, reassigning their gender just to have a place to hide as a minority. Do they really think the world is no more than a video game?

The damage does not seem reversible and a there's a fundamental lack of spiritual infrastructure amongst the folk to even try any sort of reform. Denial and delay are all it has to offer.

These people have given up hope, not in the christian sense of abandoning it, rather as a dying animal one imagines must. Their collective ego slowly uniting in their decision to call it a day (or night), like somoneone strapping on seatbelts in a steadily sinking car.

The connected planet cannot afford another covid to stop another war.

My diagnosis is clear, and course of action simple.

While I have uprooted weeds in remote parts of the galaxy before,  this is my biggest, perhaps the easiest assignment yet because this 350 year old tree has run out of not only earth to expand into, but also has lost whatever little "roots" it had to begin with.
