the last thought i had before waking up is the only thing i remember now, they wanted me to recover the golden disk set from the craft.

"as if"

"well if they're negging"

"it a power play, no doubt, for both entities can afford it"


"but they're not exactly hostile, you know what i mean"


"idgaf, i cant stand being ignored"


"ok holderin, jeez, what are yo& going to do about the pigeon?"
