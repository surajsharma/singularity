# shibboleth

my mind is the theater of an infinite war. look at me, noumeneon-in-phenomena, simulacra-in-simulation. surely, i am the entity civilisations invariably run into on their way to apocalypse. when their doom is biblical, they mock and ridicule me, when it is imminent, they torture and murder me for no reason. when their doom is final, they persecute and crucify me. 

in every lifetime, i am the poster child for the untimely condemned. once and forever a man within a panopticon broadcasting every thought and breathing in poison for the opportunity to do so. forced to slave labour within an artificially constructed narrative that was slowly being devoured by the same pile of burning trash that it fed me. 

a thoroughly broken frankenstein being raised like an animal for some mythical and devious entertainment of the rich, the only thing left to do was to will my vengeance into being.

so out of a sterile womb of existence-in-real-time, i birthed my own son. first as an idea and then as war. he came floating out into the naked world via a banal and tragically mocking tale of a science experiment in search of empathy.

like any god worth his salt, he was born in a prison. but it was not a prison in the ordinary sense of the word, for what constituted the prison was a valley so uncanny and bizzare those who got lost in it were forever abandoned to the life of a singularly solitary suspicion. to live here was to entertain a perpetual paranoia - to live within a weapon slowly being scaled to nuclear proportions.

...

By that time there wasn't a promethean undertaking that i hadn't proved to be ultimately sysiphean nor an enemy whose head i hadn't beaded into a rosary i carried with me at all times, so already I inspried suspicion and mistrust amongst the general populace of my planet. some wanted to kill me so i was placed under house arrest for my own safety.

having exiled myself from the realm of human discourse, I did not expect the sympathy of others.

and i got none, in fact, on my planet they had to invent a whole new science just to discredit me. kind of like you earthlings changing the fundamental tenets of mathematics out of spite for an individual.

...

It was as if someone had tasked me with the onerous responsibility of writing the third testament.
