# the loop

The thing about losing your mind is, once you start doing it there isn't a limit to how much you can do it. Here's an example:

My favorite number is 4.

I discovered it in a card game I was playing with dad when I must not have been older than 13. Actually that's not it, I was only re-enacting events from earlier in the day, when I had won the same card game while playing alone.

This was, of course, way before I had convinced Washington to invent a new "anti-blasphemy" drug and administer it on myself.
