While in my political infancy and mendicancy, I meditated upon these things:



Repetition and Difference
The transient nature of all things, including the illusion of "human nature‚Äù
Boundaries and Borders

individual sovereignty, self respect and ego
state secrets and what it takes to digest them
My mother's soul
My casual attitude
Sin - nature, definition, which ones to commit
Death - of others and my own
Politics as spiritual war and performance art
The idea of service and being servile, taking responsibility w/o auth etc, personal heroism
personality cults, secret societies

am i at the center of any?
Games

of strategy
open/closed
of deception
of meaning
Edges of Spirituality
The mindset of a soldier
The mindset of an immigrant
The mindset of a mumbaikar
Religion and detachment
Human rights and their evolution over time
Homosexuality and celibacy

fetishes and proclivities
Luck as a concept
loops, recursion, and patterns
Narcissism (of small differences, of images)
Racism
Feminism and toxic feminism
Money and crypto
Jealousy (miserable like us)
Hierarchies natural and man-made
Adolescence and nostalgia
what others may be thinking of me
miracles i witness
my mental health
my foul mouth and the satisfaction of cursing
my discipleship, however lukewarm, which sustained somehow despite the bs
my opinions
my ideas of innovation and jugaad
my strange lack of discontent, given my situation as a political pow, pawn, and stalking horse
late capitalism and advertisements
cowardice / nothing
art
society and its norms
paul the octopus
this accumulating narrative and experiment
my desperation for formal sannyas, something already accomplished
the consequences of creating bci software
i am jack's absolute lack of skills
my decisiveness
existentialism and what i found there, paradoxically esse est precipi
what the script demands
negative visualisation
its not what you role you are assigned, its how you play it
no fucks were given
