## increase energy

# 1) Try reducing your carbohydrates

> Here’s a good test: Can you comfortably go 16 hours without eating? Can you dip into an intermittent fast without much thought? Can you skip a meal or three without it being a big deal?

- they eat high carb, low fiber meals, which repeatedly spike  blood sugar. And then it comes crashing back down a couple hours later, resulting in sudden hunger cravings that start the cycle over. But that’s not how we are supposed to be.


- I also practice intermittent fasting- I have multiple 16+ hour periods each week without eating, which gives my body a chance to reset and helps keep insulin levels low. And because I’m used to it, it’s those fasted periods where I feel the best and most energized. When a body is used to burning fat for energy, hunger tends to come in the form of a gentle reminder rather than a craving. Most of my articles on this site were written while intermittent fasting in the morning before my first meal.


- During colder months, I eat a seasonal ketogenic diet, which is the lowest type of low-carb diet. For that period I eat under 20 net carbs a day, or about 40 total carbs per day including fiber, and my blood sugar looks like the straight green line in the chart above. (And I’ve measured it.)


- The result is that my body burns fat instead of sugar for fuel, and my brain has switched over to running on ketones instead of glucose, which is a natural human adaptation to deal with periods of low carbohydrates. Many people report increased mental clarity and energy when they are in this state, and I’m no exception.


- It’s the same state that people go into after 3 days on a fast. When people fast for religious, spiritual, or other reasons, they often report that the first day or two is hard, and then by the third day it suddenly gets easier and they feel mildly euphoric and focused, no longer hungry, and more connected to their deity. It feels like the sun finally coming out on a cloudy day.


- Here are the types of foods I personally eat: 
- Wild-caught fish, like sardines and sockeye salmon
- Limited meat, like grass-fed beef and pastured chicken
- Avocados, green beans, broccoli, bell peppers, etc.
- Leafy greens like romaine, arugula, kale, spinach, and more
- Olive oil, coconut milk, and MCT oil
- Butter and cream from grass-fed cows
- Nuts, berries, and dark chocolate
- Spices, herbs, and tea
- During my higher-carb (50-150 gram) periods, I have some rice, black beans, einkorn pasta, and goat’s milk here and there.

- During most days, I eat 2 meals per day within an 8-hour window. The other 16 hours (half of which is sleeping) is in a fasted state with just water and macha.

# 2) Increase your micronutrient intake

- And our foods have been selectively bred for convenience and desirability over nutrition, like sugary fruits with lower antioxidants, or plants with shallower roots that are easy to harvest but draw less nutrients from the soil.

- To fix this, I eat a can of sardines a few times per week.

- It’s important to note that there are two main types of Vitamin K2 molecules: the MK-4 form and the MK-7 form. The MK-4 form comes from animal fats. The MK-7 form is made from fermentation, and is particularly high in natto (fermented soybeans).

- I make sure to get both types of Vitamin K2 in my diet daily; I get the MK-4 form from grass-fed butter, ghee, pastured egg yokes, and emu oil, and I get the MK-7 form from Nutrigold supplements.

- Between sardines, wild-caught salmon, and a few teaspoons of cod liver oil a week, I get plenty of long-chain omega 3 fatty acids and retinol in my diet without going overboard.

- Collagen is the protein that makes up most of our bodies, including large portions of our bone, muscles, skin, blood vessels, tendons, and ligaments. It’s the “stuff” that holds our body together, and it’s deficient in modern diets.

- I personally take a few grams of collagen powder daily. I limit my consumption of muscle meat, and add a bit of this to peppermint tea or blackberry coconut smoothies. It’s tasteless, and serves as a useful protein source to complement and balance the rest of the protein types I eat throughout the day.

# 3) Exercise regularly (and preferably outside)

# 4) Measure your inflammation

# 5) Check your hormones

- Both men and women need enough testosterone. Obviously men need far more, but testosterone is a critical hormone for experiencing a happy mood and enough energy, and strong bones, in both genders.

- Ate a clean, fairly low-carb diet
- Took Vitamin D3
- Got enough Omega 3’s
- Reduced exposure to plastic, pesticides, and chemicals of all kinds
- Worked out with compound exercises
- Had more sex
- Tried cold baths (I’ll pass on that one!)
- Got more sleep
- Meditated, and practiced other stress-reducing changes

# 6) Replace coffee with matcha

# 7) Try MCT oil

# 8) Sleep properly

# Cold Showers - I cant stress this enough. my biggest streaks happend because of cold showers, you become so sharp, energetic and happy when you do this every morning. trust me, cold showers are a shortcut to success! 
    
# Exercise - You dont have to go to the gym for 2 hours for this one. do wathever you like, go for a run, a walk, play basketball, soccer, swim, or wathever you want. Exercise gets that extra energy out of you instead of PMO, and it also helps clearing your mind as well as cold showers. so dont skip exercise! also, you dont have to exercise every day, you can if you want to but 3 times a week is enough. also forgot to mention, exercise will build you ALOT of confidence! 
    
> Delete social media - Social media will destroy your streaks easily. just think about it, so many triggers, pictures of girls in bikini and wathever they post are every where in social media, plus, it wastes your time like a motherfucker. 
    
Eat healthy - You are what you eat. no need to say more than that, eating healthy will make you feel better, more energetic and focused. at least quit sugar, you can have junk maybe once week. sugar is the worst thing you can put in your body unless its from fruits. 
    
Meditate - this one is kinda miss understood by most people, i also didnt understand it until i tried. meditation is just amazing in every aspect i can think of. when you meditate regularly you just feel bliss everyday, you become so much more focused, happy, mindfull and stress free, meditating is unbelieveably amazing. i reccomend trying the "6 phase meditation" from Mindvalley. 
    
Work on a project - it could be whatever you want, start an online business, draw something, compose a song, write a poem, write for a blog, or watever comes to your mind. do something that makes you think and work for an hour or two. you will feel great when you finish. 
    
Stay busy - this is really important, when you have more to do, you dont have time to even think about PMO, what i mean by staying busy is keep doing stuff, it doesnt have to be important. hang out with some friends ( really good in the first days of your streak), be with your family, watch a show that you like, do whatever. just do something. 
    
Dont lie in your bed - this is kinda part 2 for staying busy. make sure that you dont just lie in your bed with your phone being lazy, because eventually you will start thinking about PMO and you have no time for that because you are a busy person remember? Make you bed every morning so its less inviting to lying around. 
    
Declutter - Be organized, that way you have less things to worry about, organize your room or work space, and where you spend alot of time, organize your computers files (its actually important), your google tabs and more, you get the idea. 
    
Drink water - its good for you. 
    
Learn - keep learning about things that interest you, wether its self growth, writing, dancing, business, or watever. make your brain work.
