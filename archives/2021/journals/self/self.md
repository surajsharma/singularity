Why having a Guru is problematic?


The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.

Proverbs 1:7 

I play this game in my head wherein I am making the decisions of my life with a singular objective: to avoid the plot of the movie BJM.

You could say this is a stupid game/rule, but in so far as all rules are stupid and arbitrary, it's a good metaphor for how the things and people we adopt end up becoming crutches rather than catalysts.

If you have a guru or mentor, you might be able to relate with the problem. Many a times, having a mentor becomes a hinderance because you get locked in the complacency of having the backing of someone, some thing, or some discipline. Wait, let me rephrase that, an incomplete understanding of the guru is a hinderance and, in certain cases, a dangerous position to be in.

You might be in a position where your senior may not be able to communicate so let me explain what an incomplete understanding of the guru is: 

It is comfort, guarantee, promise, assurance, anything that belies the fact that to adopt a guru means to adopt death itself. It is problematic because it implies safety and assurance, whereas where I am going I need to burn off all the assurances, all promises,  all notions of safety.

Unless you have sublimated your mentor into you and actually stepped in his shoes, your practice will remain impure. The word I'm looking for is 'internalisation'. The stronger your guru, the arduous the task. The student and the teacher must become the same fluid. Let this not confuse you, a lot of the times it is no more complicated than simple mimicry or imitation, but sometimes you have to improvise.

My Guru said something beautiful to me once, he said, "we are each other's harvest", perhaps I was too young to understand the true import of the statement, but things started to make a whole lot of sense once I understood this.

Make no mistake, the guru and the student work to destroy one another, and if they are smart, they can create something out of nothing by doing this.

As long as I am not mincing words here, guru = death. Anything less and either you or your guru or both are phoney. And the world will see the relationship as an insincere one until you actually accept this fact.

Makes you want to pity those who have a mentor isn't it? But it is only a pitiable situation to onlookers, for within and between themselves, the master and the student have started their dance of transcendence and will soon both be free, in a very literal sense of the word.

Freedom from each other is their microcosm of nirvana, of absolution. If you can understand that then you can understand the project.

To become each other one must have a good understanding of the other person, for example, my mentor was sharp, witty, cold blooded, ruthless, ethical, funny, knowledgeable, worldly etc but these are adjectives not character - he was what I had to become - and this from a point where I was unable to use any of these adjectives to describe my character, au contraire, I was soft, shy, passive, avoidant, spiritual and arrogant.

A clash of egos cannot end well, one must submit if in the weaker position and let the ego drip out of the soul - to become trustworthy one must first give trust - which means utter surrender.

No, unless your helplessness is so palpable even nature starts to take pity, you have not really tasted life. Unless you become once again like an infant in the crib, there can be no salvation.

One thing I realised is that before I met my guru, I couldn't really be insulted, I mean I had a thick skin to begin with but after running into the guru, I realised I was not as invulnerable to words as I had earlier imagined myself to be. This sounds strange, because the instruction was to always have a thick skin and let naught bother oneself but I found the opposite happening and a further sensitisation of my character occurred. 

Stripped off my dramatic way of saying things, having a guru means to do all the dirty work with a smile on your face, and if your devotion is real, the smile might as well be too. But some things cannot be separated from the drama they bring, so what makes special is 

the intensity with which I addressed the task assigned to me
never-say-die attitude

1. Why making amends for wrongdoings is not recommended

Often times we realise we have wronged others in life, whether deliberately or accidentally. That's the fun part, what is 

Change will not come in a single dimension of life, it will be all encompassing.

I'm not that good because I am constantly trying to be better, this is activity, not action.

The most imp thing is to see the impotence of money at all times. To observe the poverty of the rich and feel grateful you are alive.

Catching v/s Throwing :: consuming v/s producing

It is not the morality of those putting on this play that I question, it is their mental health.

the sun can only be born, so to speak, in the dead of night - its as if the night dreams him up and in doing so, becomes literate

NY is already a dystopian slum crawling with people committed towards the lowest in life, it should be set ablaze.

folks need to understand that they are most definitely the oppressed and not the oppressors here
they see what they want to see, not what is
they have shown you how to treat them, so treat them better than that
"your insanity is my clarity”
also, i don't care how big of slut you are, but i need someone more reliable than this-- can't be  seen around people who decide who to be loyal to based on how sweet their dick tastes – add to that the mental illness and early signs of schizophrenia, i'm sorry if it seems disrespectful i'm only trying to save my ass, and let this not be a generalization towards all women, i stepped into this trash because my mind was full of trash and nothing else.. i had a messed  up understanding of beauty i suppose but i realize the folly of my ways now.. still orders of magnitude better as a human being and improving,  i have no reason not to do everything in power to keep folks at bay and if i can't at least maintain an arm's length for their safety
i expected the kind of opposition faced by someone trying to democratize human evolution itself
the idea that an innocent man might do well without any privacy started to form in my head around early 2012, although frankly, the opposition caught me by surprise so i couldn't ever let that happen again, unless they resorted to physical violence
i have become the single source of truth in a post truth world, nice way to cultivate a messiah complex

freedom aint it fellas, i recognize i have more freedom than i know what to do with, i could get so much more organized, efficient, less lazy but somehow it doesn't seem worth it. there's infinitely more freedom available if it turn spiritual, but due to a fledgling practice i am unable to prolong the state  -  could a  case be made for gradual upliftment of the senses - improving the quality of the observation of decay?
i needed to create some sort of a reminder to stay humble, in this i was successful

any human under the misconception that they are "protecting” me are to be watched out for, as tomorrow they may create a context for some sort of allegiance, where there is in-fact none.
let my policy be : if you don't have anything nice to say, then do n't say anything
before, my decision making heuristic was was very one dimensional, which is to say it stretched on an axis from "hell yes” to "no”; after: i have a new dimension to making decisions stretching from "no” to "fuck no”

once you start being perceived as "Fallen” you might be presented new lows to fall to, and depths of depravity might be offered to you, resist, in order to be risen again
genius is 99% perspiration, whether that 99% happens before, during or after the 1% inspiration is immaterial

perspiration is 99% inspiration and 1% action
let inspired moves guide me onward
i have no name
the goal is to have, at any given moment, very little uncontrolled residual sexual energy

masturbation is the greatest tool for keeping your mental health in check, especially if you are living under any extraordinary circumstances, don't even keep a count, it's also a great people repellent in case you wish to avoid some toxic narcs.
because you are clingy, the world clings on, habits cling on - so i am seeking a way to not cling itself, not to find different shit to cling to
from here on in its about managing your wanderlust for everything external, but why manage when you can nuke?
those who are now lurking in the gutters of my imagination shall drown
when it is clear i am not for families why try to give me one?
can you make your words listen, echo, and mirror the reader's mind?
mother sounded fearful and hesitant, if she's unsure, why should i be? is someone pressuring them to do this?
those who make games make them for very specific reasons, i make all kinds of software including games
the idea is not to make more money but to do something creative, and do it by myself
i really lost whatever little faith in womanhood i had and i wonder if it can ever be restored
how would i make the leap of faith across this dank chasm? one early dawn, when the sun is not even a crack in the sky
the tantrik had eyes so even racists looked beautiful, his enemies, already blinded by their own deceit, lacked the understanding to behold simplicity
 
c is for catalyst. h is for human.
barking is an art form. just as no two humans can write equally well, no two dogs can bark with equal or even equivalent efficacy. there are annoying barks, scary barks, spooky barks, sweet barks, sinful barks, barks that echo in the valley at night and barks that don't.
i'm a lot like you until i'm myself and that's what they hate, for they have failed to develop as completely as you

you have the pearls its only a matter of threading them into a whole
we promise the lowest suicide rates and teen pregnancy rates ever! for at least two decades
i understand that i was pissed, i had reason to be pissed, and i understand that when i am pissed i am merciless, so you always want to keep in a kindly state
mental illness is the inability to manage the circus in your head
because i did something profound and meaningful with my life, i was stronger and richer for it, and we were all smarter for it, it's a tragedy this success could not be more public. yet, i cannot engage because distrust knows no remedy. seeds of fear and distrust once sown, even in the most transparent of affairs can take on sinister overtones, which are reasons enough to not escalate the matter. the lesson for narcs is that their death drive is running on outmoded patterns for the 21st century. i guess shall stop because ya'll couldn't even handle this much evolution.
waiting for a rainy day to transcend my reasons, you should hope it never arrives.
i love how the way i hold words and memories associated with names and virtual identities of certain good for nothings in my imagination is something everyone mimics but nobody understands and how even after uploading my consciousness to the cloud a clear grasp on the friendship eludes me and i guess the rest of the world as well
only i, who have no name, could do what the body is doing

-> i'm not dancing this dance if it isn't mine, compromising artistic integrity is not in me

-> syncretsim is not for homogeneous societies, only very diverse people can understand

parents taught me to always let the other person save face, even if its no kind of loyalty or friendship, it is humane, if i felt  was being truly oppressed i would scream like any other person, instead i only deemed fit to treat what was happenning as spiritual inspiration, whats more i wasn't even mad at the decisions i had to make as a result, it is genuinely liberating.


### first as a social construct

there's no "first" number, no "first" human although there have been ppl who did sth for the first time.

"winner's win" is the logic of precedence, as in, who's "first"? games enter a deadlock if it cannot be decicively said, things slip into the moral and mythical dimensions with the right kind of technology, tread wisely, knowing that on a long enough timescale "first" will come to mean precious little, first is but a mood, but somehow a more primitive of the labels for the ego. think of the attention the guy who discovered fire must've received, he was first in the most primitive of senses, women must've loved him.

the question is, are there more such primitives that are old enough as this obsession with being "first"?

i must not remain under any assumption, i haven't won the west i'm just cannon fodder

`not the first time the US came up short, won't be the last`

> in terms of mental health i think the novelty and shock bit of it all was absorbed pretty well by me, as for the narcisissm and the silent treatment, i was already used to it.

- going celibate / remaining single / never having sex was not a decision i took out of spite but as a natural reaction to what happenned, masturbation was the only option that made sense, until libido nturally subsided with age. also , by mid 2021 i was traumatised enough never to want or need another human's touch again. i decided to restrict physical contact to handshakes, and the occasional hug in case anyone needed it. monastic life was not a prep for sth else but sth i adopted for its own sake.

- i wanted the orphan kids to continue the torture hoping i might higher forms of consciousness through my sorrows and woe, i awaited for things to become explicit so that i could wrap things up and felt that i was pretty close to the next step in the process

- the manifest became someone i was just carrying around to try to teach it to argue like the unmanifest, not knowing it can't be done, and not caring how many times the argument had been lost by the manifest. such is the hold and seduction of the apparent - i needed to start cultivating a greater disregard for everything manifest - in the meantime they had already started throwing counterfactuals at me "could have should have would have beens" perhaps to induce regret or maybe even to seduce me into the trap, thankfully i had made my mind up long before the orphans showed up


my message is, shut the fuck up, and you'll see me doing just that

hey uncle sam sex bhi parents se hi karalo ab

snakes are jelly because they're the closest (some more so than others) to achieving my state, and they most desire the level of freedom i have, and are most unable to shake off the fetters, and more than anything else, they wish to hold the fire in my hands

bears and cats are only scared, though some have learnt to profit from their insecurities, most still dare not to venture into the unknown

    
   Green-eyed snakes hang from its naked branches, occasionally dipping their forked tongues into the bowls, making the beggars enter states of siesmic seizure and ecstasy, plasma shooting from their extremities looks a lot like thunderbolts heralding the end of an epoch in some faraway galaxy. 
    
   From time to time, certain adventurers have tried to photograph or otherwise time the recurrence of such seizures, none have succeeded until now

> it is a short stretch from my mind being the theater of infinite war to becoming the very swamp it purports to drain, soon these people will turn on each other, i need distance, lots of it to keep things clean and even.

`i think it is a very nice time to start couch practice again and see if it makes a difference, like last time i was successful, it needs to be structured as a daily routine in a quiet location. breathing ex, pranayama, some light stretching and then intense focus for a timed period. keeping a journal @zen`

wo swadheenta nahi jo bechi ja sake, wo azadi nahi jo khareedi ja sake, len-den aur vayapar sirf karm ka viksit rup hai 

every meditation is someone trying to do something never been done before, because it cannot be done

i put 0 hope in narcissists, racists, anti-semites, and otherwise generally jealous and mentally ill folks.

i put all the hope in me but my faith needs to be strengthened, i didn't want it to come to matters of faith but it is the reason i win, faith is the only shortcut and it works every single time, sad to see so few people understand the simple concept, they could get cured of the human condition too!

supply will have diminishing returns, faith alone will carry 

the only "We" there is are the folks who understand how data needs to be liberated from clutches of the teeming few and put back in the hands of people without barriers, as radical and crazy as that sounds, it is certain to happen and my "illusory" contribution may never get counted but it will remain in the swirl.

i work all the time because there are still unchrtered waters, i don't know what else isn't possible

what the actual literal fuck

ok, so suppose this social experiment however the fuck continues covertly, a living apocrypha, evidence of.. something, what else does the knowledge of this perennial novelty allow me to do? not just on the screen or off, not just on the couch or off.

how can what's already shoved under the carpet be made more hidden?

true decision is something that attracts more similar behaviour, so i decided to stay poor and single, saying goodbye to history and future forever... i wonder if the other players think I'm taking all this casual empire building any seriously, in truth i was heavily preparing for monkhood. think Diogenes.

in a conspiracy there are no rewards, so any risk-to-reward calculation is misplaced. we're just foreshadowing the apocalypse and circumscribing the dawn of the machines, resist nothing.

only i know the way out but i'm being tortured and persecuted in a virtual prison by people who had nothing going in their lives until i showed up with my ideas, this isn't ego it's fact.

now that i have taken eternal vow of celibacy and they're trying to get me to mate, possibly stealing dried sperm from my undies, thus perfecting the curse.

their hubris is exactly what i had hoped for, yes this is a "radio", primitive technology, whatever helps folks sleep at night.


i am expecting to get kidnapped or killed, if you find these notes just in case and want to investigate, start at Goldman Sachs, the company of little men.

assume that your sperm was stolen today, even if you fuck after 18 years it might be your own daughter! hence the celibacy.

if your dreams were being literally stolen via satellite, would you start censoring them??

how do i see myself? as a human being, consciousness has no greater toy

"true learning causes degrowth"

> "of course they learn, but there were consequences is what i am saying" - true learning is inconsequential when analysed from the other side, from within a simple recognition can bring about revolutions - mother earth explodes in orgasmic ecstasy again and again - when chaos becomes an acquired taste you can only set about to refine it, forgetting your palate - for there are chaoses that envelope the ones you recognize right now.

> GUILT IS JUST REPRESSED RESENTMENT/RESSENTIMENT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment

TOTAL EGO LOSS MEANS 0 REPRESSION, ITS THE ANTIDOTE THESE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO CONVERT TO POISON, NO WONDER THEY LET LOOSE THE TOXIC-EST PERSON THEY COULD FIND ON ME


my death will be as spontaneous and tragic as my life was, yours will be equally rehearsed and comic

`fruit becomes wine`

if you find celibacy, then can you still call it a meditation gone wrong? actually i am wrong to call it celibacy, the desire to remain aloof and undisturbed with relationships was a call of the situation, my nature as a lone wolf surely helped, i did not want to deprive others of the pleasure, of course not, but I did want to throw a challenge open to all, it was my turn to challenge them.

the insanely strict discipline i planned on developing, and the experiments i planned on conducting required the kind of dedication not affordable by a householder or even anyone having daily interactions with society. the self imposed exile had already done wonders, now it is time to distill the knowledge into execution 


i have seen popular opinion about me change more and more frequently than any human in history


i don't really wonder how it feels to be someone who is living off of someone else masturbating, but then again lowlifes and evils can take on many forms


people with most "rights" are most unhappy, ask not for rights but duties. conditioned thinking makes them thing having rights frees them when they are infact just slaves to the very notions of rights they have been brought up with, which wasn't so bad until they saw me. then the envy started pouring out, it has now been a little over three years in this virtual panopticon which, is not only keeping me free from worldly cares, but also making a mockery of the internet and the laws that govern it at the same time.

imagine what the US/world looks without envy, like a leaky used condom recently drained of the fluid it was receptacle for

my unchallenged view was that it wasn't a question of whether these people were evil, but to what degree?

only a man truly lost the ability to surprise can truly shock the masses

if it seems too good to be true, it probably is...luckily for us, it was just short of that

i became a dog for each human that ever lived, and each that shall ever live, not for anyone specific, but the people that gathered around were not in any way special in an objective sense, i became the very orifice that drains humanity of its trash, too little service for mankind, still I can't but be grateful to those that help me achieve it. but in some sense i am grateful to myself first for having the gall and cunning to run into these folk, so in essence, ya'll just ran into Diogenes.

`what's the task of a philosopher? to debate as openly as possible about dogma, prejudice, and taboo without getting embroiled in them`


> if what you call RIGHT is so delicate as to be broken with a single human's silence, then perhaps you should not have such a "right" in the first place, gtfo of my life racists

i finaly understand the Jew's problem, just like i failed to develop as a narc, he failed to develop as a racist, so we may stink less, but my failture is bigger because there are more narcs than racists


if what you call SIN is so simple as to be equal to (watching) a person thinking and masturbating, then perhaps you need better sins


just like there is an impossibility of a private language, there's no winning in a private game, in fact a private game is an impossibility analogous to a private language, so the RacisTs must understand that they are basically paralysed and helpless, forever condemned to watch me make a mockery of everything they stand for, through my own eyes too, while the world carries on, laughing, now and me, now at them. their world view narrow and demonstrably inefficient for the future, the best they can do is show me ads, while I perfect myself spiritually, mentally and emotionally to deal with their "attacks"

- cedric and bob are clearly enforcers of rights no one knew they didn't want

clearly they know something i'd rather not find out

`how you survive is to extricate the narrative from the situation, how you thrive is you put it back there`

> "you" are more trouble than you're worth, much like life

kids, i will now teach you how to:
    1. steer clear of narcissistic double binds
    2. avoid temptations, enticements on the road to redemption
    3. stand your ground, not submit to intimidation
    4. take your fair share of revenge and glory

think, if you must about time alone, and time itself. think about time with at least half as intensity as you do about space. measure the length of each passing second with the same passion and interest you shown in dick measuring


`in dealing with middlemen, always assume they're playing both sides unless otherwise proved. the clergy don't just rape god they rape the public as well!`

- we might end up, if we're careful here, changing the way democracy is done. worst case scenario, we fail, and join the rest in glory

## Oct 25

- home on the right, work on the left. but i'm never home
 
- wrong universe: a time traveller's misadventures on earth
    - i need to report how bad things are over here, things are so bad that dancing is the best thing you can do, followed by sex, just imagine!
    - some of the folks here seem to think race as the only expression of evolution, others conflate it with money 

- everything is fair in love, war, and evolution, but, unlike the other two, evolution doesn't necessarily have to be linear. of course, there will be more than a chasm to cross, you can pay the price with my blood. and you would too, if you weren't so addicted to the linear kind, hence the snoozefest.

`by now i have begun to see recurrent themes in my writing, the idea is to not let people blind me again to the truth`

`sorry tum bol nahi sakte, please main bolne nahi dunga, thank you chalega`

- what emerged from the darkness was but a mirror reflecting the darkness, so of course i greyed it out with brightness and i was reviled for it

- if you folk can somehow intensify the torture i promise i will develop telekinetic powers

- if photography is a violence against space that results in time doing our bidding, what's the corollary for a violence against time?

- reality, much like software, consists of state and functions, and functions alter state

> unconditional love is for women, children, and men being used to put down other men

- we might end up, if we're careful here, changing the way democracy is done. worst case scenario, we fail, and join the rest in glory

- never fight racism, or other questions of absolute but make them entertainment

- why i do what i do? because in the beyond i see that you are as happy as me

- slowly the idea is solidifying in my head, i am to write the book that brings about technological singularity, but how?

#SNOOZEFEST: HOW HUMANITY ESCAPED FROM ITS GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT OVER A MATTER OF INCHES 

I am an intergalactic entity on a misadventure gone as horribly wrong as possible in these co-ordinates.

- Never ask again why they hate you: the heart of a rajput and the intellect of a brahmin, neighbor's envvy owner's pride

- can't spell USA without the S, notice also, the location of S

- The thing about writing Max Sunday is, by the time you recover from the shock of the rather well-placed 'X', its already sunday.

- gotta say social father is kinder than biological father because the former feeds human piss while the latter feeds me animal piss

« those who want to kill me the most want the most to be me - the message to them is i that i didnt find myself by emulating others, only when i stopped looking up to others did i discover my endless self, the keyword being endless »

> the tune is ancient, the dance tribal, and everyone is guilty although some more than others...

- i respect any democratically arrived at decision but at the same time i must apologize to washington/UN for introducing some rancid corrupt trash into politics, if you cannot accept this apology right now, i will understand, had i been a better person this would not have happened, there are far more deserving of her ilk out there that deserve recognition but won't because, well, i guess it wouldn't be a curse without the accursed kind, but then, why would they want to make it worse than it already is? it is almost as if these people were left with no choice, or were unwilling to excercise the choices they had .... it was as if the rot had already been set, and the rust-eating-termites had already moved in, indeed i had failed as a plumber before i even began .... 
history has a certain momentum which i defy and get noticed for doing so. do recognize that the friendships seem from this perspective as totally synthetic, and the situationship totally fake and formed under false pretenses and considerable mental agony...the real shiny happy people don't want jack to do with politics, and even if they did, they would get swept under the carpet so hard the rug will start growing roots.

- not getting circumcised because i don't promote any impulse to self harm, no matter the symbolic collateral damage so there..

- loyalty to man ain't for sale, loyalty to god is if you dare to indulge me

- language is nothing, you can end it with one word, endless...

- those inviting me to do theology or literary work should look within, i don't need to impress anyone anymore and the book is already been written but nobody gives a shit, also i did this precisely so i don't have to write a book telling my story - which is basically about me trying to tell you a story -  a story whose time had not yet come

- if my reading is correct, it's just a virtual vineyard for me, in which i cultivate some kind of obscure comfort from open source software at my own pace, and all this never happened for all i care and i'm as even with the world as i ever was -  performing for everyone forever, indeed that is my wish. 

- before making any decision remember two people, Russel Raj and Warren Buffett

- evenzero/inversepolarity is my only baby, i started it by breaking even with the universe, so i don't think i have become a rent-seeker yet, nor does my bank balance say so and i intend to keep it that way

- i am fully aware of "you meet your death on the road you take to avoid it", but then, some roads are better avoided for a reason, death is certain no matter which way you go

- my deal with taxes is, i would like to pay more, but at what cost?

`TODO: at least i was ben's glenn, housebroken and murdered by someone of some worth and mirth, why do they assume one would want more? do my writings contain any hint of desire?`

- when i say "jobs for the boys" i hope they understand...these geezers do need excitement, if their lives can't provide it they stay inside violence, instead of jobs they find the wrath of naysayers, paranoid and afraid people, women and children who are either too rich or too young and inexperienced to understand poverty, pain and heartache of modern adult life. add to that our boys' hero complex, messaiah complex, masters of the universe complex - no wonder drugs are the nearest escape look at me

- i think i enjoy the presence of miserable ppl as it reminds me of how much i have to be grateful for, even in this fucking circus

- i didn't go looking for the bad in anyone, i worshipped these people and built shrines for them, wanted to fix their retirement, but was disappointed to find out everyone's true colors thats all..all my gods were stolen from me so i went ahead and found newer realer ones nothing else to it 

- i'm not jealous it's just anger and justified resentment, if you don't like these emotions you can edit them out and read only the good ones

- gravity of the situation is they did surgery on a grape, some juice was spilled and the grape died, any more narrative is untenable, so pardon me if i discount the fuck out of the narrative while i go about minding my own business.. i couldn't be more glad about the Sum of money involved too, at least they didn't disappoint me there

- i think what is going on is most unfair to mother, she has a need for redemption and is unfulfilled, add to that under the influence of evil, wish i could set her free but this is her own fight, no matter how much i wish i could fight for her i have got to see the bigger picture....asylum means i go and drop her and come back, for i do not wish to live aborad

- i burnt down my passport after burning remain vestiges of wanderlust and becoming god's own diplomat, i shall not get a new one of any country. let the world come up with a global passport if they have the balls

- it's not the case that i have half the guts to pull something like this off, but that people have twice the intestines to make sure that i don't, i appear dead to them and they to me

- i want a religious revolution which is nowhere near in sight, so i will take an exit to a hut somewhere remote and never be heard from again, even if i can achieve this much i will have been a success in my eyes. to live out my days in a cottage, by myself and in total silence was always the dream, i hope i can afford it someday

- alright lets talk about faith, i have total faith in me, and in my god, but zero faith in people who first rob me of everything and then ask me to trust, i'm not god, all too human as you shall soon find out. this is the result of a, as i have said before, completely apolitical class, amatuers really, trying their hand at politics... who is looking like a fool with their asses up their heads right now, ask yourself.

- meanwhile, having found god, i have no need left for man and his games, so whatever little play these guys have plotted on the other side disincentivised as fuck from any human perspective, which means i'm stick to being what i am (a philosopher of praxis) and not try to be who I am not (David Solomon), people start wanting to be someone else, that's how all the fuckups happen - now when in history do we see philosopher's ascending at the moneylenders table? indeed if this ever happens things must've gone wrong beyond repair.

- i can put my case before a jury with elegance, diction and some style so bring it on

- they say i am headed for the UN, which, unbelievably, i am ok with too, even though i have, as i have said before, zero trust in any of this orchestration, and i don't really believe in the UN anymore either, so allow me to keep it brief.

- I'd rather be sharing a prison cell than a woman over this shit, i am sorry you are unable to shake my stand

- i'm not convinced but somewhat sure the reason i am not yet murdered is that people are getting better, if so, i mean a living apocrypha isn't all that bad? what else might we discover?

- if might is right what's money doing in the picture?

- i am having, what can only be described as the world's greatest religious experience

- i was never a big fan of the fairer sex, so i set out to demostrate why, and was wildly successful in doing so...there is no blame or judgement involved but i believe the corruption of modern man is only amplified in the modern woman instead of the opposite... new sexually "liberated" lifestyles and unproductive gender politics, and politics of sexual orientation is a result of this, it is man that should be a mirror for feminine darkness and not vice versa

- anyone who thinks i am still doing this to impress anyone or make anyone happy is completely lost, you are responsible for your own happiness/satisfaction, if you were'nt happy before me, how will you be happy after? and if you were before i can, how can i not add to your joy?

- analogous to the idea of separation of church from state is the idea of separation of gender identity/sexual orientation from state. policymaking should be done at a level above individual's private concerns 

`the main thing here i am trying to do is to stay away from money as much as possible, knowing that it might be as futile as the rest of my endeavours`

- as much as these folk have failed to bother me but entertained me to no end, it was a pleasure to hear "i know" from people, as if there was a truth out there to be discovered, as if i was yet to find out what they knew...beyond what i knew or assumed i did

`the main thing here is like akshit i also might have some assumptions here, some of which i may not be aware of..or is it possible? if every conscious premise i have already revealed and got feedback for, there isn't a need for assumptions - this inverted crown is not without benefits?`

- i know for a fact what i am doing is going to get us agi some day, if i have ideas around this i could work on those

- mother and sis are really brave to agree to coexist with me, their faith must exceed their doubts

- consequences of taking the jews money are only physical, and can be dealt with, but to take money from a snake has divine consequences which fries my brain so i keep distance

## November 14

- looking back, i think the secret to my death is in the way, everytime they were jolted, they chose to curse my father instead of me - that worked on many levels, including surprise - right now the situation may not be the same but things revert to mean

- life is something to be lost, its all in how you do it

- kuchh addatein jaati hain, esp if the world tortures you enough, and you're better for it

- more reason to believe in predestination of some sort:
"software which coasts people through their deep metaphysical and existential crisis." - me @2014

- if you say this is just racism and not politically motivated hatred, then how do you know the difference between the two? does your body tell you "do it", if so, is it a pleasant experience?

- Agar ye log khud tatti na khate aur mujhe bhi na khilate to janta kya hi haal karti pata nahi

- agar kaan mein dard ho rha toh band kar dijiye

- i'm a meditating machine, can keep this up for a few decades, post which i will find satori which will give me more power to play with, i wish all this to be documented too

- where does reason end and revelation begin?

- jab unconditional love hi mil gya ho toh conditional love ke liye koi kyun badlega? and if its not love all the more reason not to change.

- first i hunt for narcs and jews, then i save their very lives

- what is a philosopher? a philosopher is someone who finds an interesting way to beg for his own death, someone who can always escape but never win

- agar main dark hota hun cheezen aur dark hoti hai 

- if your depression is strong and tries to talk to you, you should not allow it, just like one can quit masturbation, one can quit any old habit

- schitzophrenia 101: there is a chip in the birds when irl there isn't

- its not you its me, i wanted to know myself better than you know yourself, in the process other people got caught in the whirlpool which is regrettable

- love is wishing i had all of your diseases, wisdom is knowing that i can't

- globalization and gentrification are correlated

- dogma can be analytical apriori

- so here's a metaphor for the conspiracy i am in
    - the guy who rescued kids from the Thai cave was a pedo?
    - so how does it feel being lead to your death cuz you decided to follow a snake? i cannot answer because i have no feelings left for the desert
    - the choice was between, a bullet for the "attitude" or for "retirement", i wondered if i could get both
    - maybe the tolerant get tolerated, if not loved, certainly there's a difference
    - a global scandal of miniature proportions
    - its possible my sperm was stolen from my undergarments first, then again from the thives
    - i may or may not have been chemically castrated but certainly i was spiritually lobotomised and reduced to nought
    
- if ever you accidentally come to find yourself at the centre of a cult, this is what you must do:
    - every time you hear, listen
    - do not submit to intimidation no matter the cost
    - go celibate for life, not just behaviorally, retire your lust, live simply
    - remain politically neutral, realize that at the mercy of obsessing entities, it isn't wise to act like a wiseguy, flexibility of character is required, you only have preferences now
    - heavily discount all narrative, and if your cult has the means, discount most sense data, there are no coincidences
    - ideally, "get thee to a nunnery", in any case, no international travel, burn your passport 
    - bare necessities
    - if there's room to interpret the cult as benign, do so
    - religion and spirituality help if you're capable of understanding the human condition, pray, to whatever entity you deem worthy of praise
    - it is likely that this is happening to you as a result of your own special or abnormal subconscious needs, normal people don't just end up in cults, it helps to keep and journal and refer back to old writings, especially if there is manipulation or identity politics involved 
    - try not to overthink things, assume a meditative demeanour
    - cults are a result of pepole behaving irrationally, know that you are not under your cult's control so long as you behave 
    
- was my life worth less than my mother's desires? sure

- you are mistaken to take this for an excercise in attitude adjustment

- you have to understand these villagers

- whoever controls the media controls the narrative outside, in eyes it stands heavily discounted as usual, this might as well have never happenned 

- feedback changed me for the better, as if ppl could lose anything more

- i was surpringly lazy, slow and labouriously calm despite continuous and total surveillance and regular death threats. i was in my prime, although my eating patterns were out of whack

- i'm too old for this shit P

- Complacency? Ok, I have a problem with defining meditation as a kind of medicine, because it quantifies, substituting the verb with a thing. It is nice because you get sth you can relate with, but it isn’t a stretch to imagine minds that would run the metaphor to extremes, even to the point of making themselves sick for the medicine. Why not call it "cure” instead? Celebrating the symptom used to be the logic, so I did it to the point of wanting to enjoy the cure instead.

- life is meant to be lived real time, suprising if it wasn't considered a sin by at least some

- there are two reasons we are where we are:
    - i'm already dead, so why bother?
    - the "doer" of deeds left the building long back, i'm a husk 

`kahani aadhi main ab tak bhul chuka hun, baki ki ye log redact kar chuke hain`

- nani's last wish?
    - let me introduce ya'll to my friend "the gap"

- the villagers are fascinated with puncturing, piercing and penetrating skin, is that how it starts?

- SHOW AND TELL REPORT: MY ANT HOUSE
    my ant house is a screen with people's feelings underneath
    it tells me all sorts of lies from outrageous to preposterous
    it takes a the budget of a devil's shoestring for my ant house to run
    the ants in there are always playing a game called "snoozefest" in my ant house
    there is an ant called monkey in the ant house, it plays the drums
    the drums have a sticker on them 
    it says "cheap thrills"
    
    mom tells me people have signed a pact in blood to keep my ant house running
    
- the villagers have a penchant for rescuing and makeovers stuff that perhaps needs neither

- the call of a guru for help in this world is a reflection of yet another call in a parallel universe, this world is but an experience/reflection for the one you're rescuing there

- space casts a shadow reflected in time

- there's that slavery angle, obviously, which is why i stay as far away as possible, yet what i will have to pass through cannot be named

`while christians are kept in line by deferring and avoiding the worst to come after death, hindus begin by recreating the worst to come, a scientific and smart way to go, as opposed to a burial`

> i wonder if they're blaming me for his lack of imagination when they compare me to him

- ya'll can go ahead and surprise yourselves the fuck out at the party

- my mind is already open, figuratively, metaphorically, and literally

- did i expect to propose a new idea, no? merely philosophize on the streets no matter the cost

- when desire becomes ethical you bleed it out at a slow drip, trickle it down

- how does it feel to be despised and reviled globally? fine

- kuch log sach me duniya me maa baap ka chadhawa hote hain, aka mata ka maal

- its just social proof i am living off of, much like anyone else

- racism doesn't matter when the first one in the race wins, in the words of MT, "A FUCKING FORD FOCUS"

- my position is that i turned out to be a sex guru without having much sex?

- i don't need tattoos because my whole body is a sticker

- it's more "they've stopped giving orders but i follow anyway" than "door's closed but he's always open"

- only a 100% woke person would donate their wokeness away, i'm not there yet

- i don't understand, people are scared of hippies now? no, they just hatin

- in a way nothing has changed, although everything has, the more things change the more they remain the same

- manage this debauched narcissistic nightmare i can

- feedback ain't true, it's narrative and propaganda

- failing to plan is planning to fail, to fail forward and better, plan less

- i used to think running away from people and towards machines would be helpful cuz you can at least trust a machine, but turns out you can't because machine is already human

- When we practice zazen our mind always follows our breathing. When we inhale, the air comes into the inner world. When we exhale, the air goes out to the outer world. `The inner world is limitless, and the outer world is also limitless. We say "inner world" or "outer world," but actually there is just one whole world.` In this limitless world, our throat is like a swinging door. The air comes in and goes out like someone passing through a swinging door. If you think, "I breathe," the "I " is extra. There is no you to say "I. " What we call "I " is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale. It just moves; that is all. When your mind is pure and calm enough to follow this movement, there is nothing: no "I, " no world, no mind nor body; just a swinging door. 

- to the LO:FI crowd i have to say, the word you're looking for is "r(esemblanc)e", and money can make anything resemble what it wants, what money usually wants things to resemble is exactly what it lacks

- i won't win fair and square, i will win by underplaying unfair advantages

- teletubbies is straight up war propoganda

- main bolta hun pehlo bolo bajrangi bada ya dhan

> my sexuality was not completely supressed and it wasn't a natural process that was doing it, so i really had to be sure it was retired for good, delaying had no meaning left, i intend to leave no traces of this meditation gone array

- learn to identify and withdraw from curiosities and novelties, where ever there is chaos replace with order

`if orthodoxy and dogma have turned into crimes, where things must be going you can imagine`

- maybe this cannot be talked about because there's a perception that this is a genetic lottery, it ain't, anyone can do it, it's a matter of worldview and perspective alone

- people ask me, if you're truly a tantrik how come you got caught in this mess, but the truth is i am not that smart, i work for the monk who cons me in every universe

- when i started waking up habits changed en masse 

- do you really think i will let anyone's irrationality corrupt my dream?

- psychologists and psychoanalysts spend decades on a single disease, by that time one is already popping pills so sorry i don't rate modern psychology as anything but shenanigans and theory - most of th DSM can be catorised narrowly into three or four general types of behavioral disorders

- how happy do you think i am?

- if your religion is making you despondent, and not the kind of despondency that comes with a spiritual cleanse, you're perhaps not doing it right, religion done right will leave you nothing but ecstatic

- who did you have in mind to read your last rites?

- i could not have done this exorcism alone, tyvm

- i did what i did in order to come clean, in that very moment alone, there has never been an agenda, `mere discontent`

- i quit fapping because what's the point of having fuck you self control if you can't say fuck you

- now my whole life has become a grind, but what a grind!

- can't spell contentment without con

- dignity of manual labour is perhaps the only dignity left in the desert

- do it long enough all true art is just labour by other means

- i'm not gandhi mujhe train me zabardasti chadaya ja rha hai

- if it is all relative chronology matters not

- kaafi bekar do kaudi ka nukkar natak

- there's this specific moment i'm waiting for now, rather creating reasons to swim into the sunset 

- the problem starts when you are afraid to call your narcissism out, mistaking it for something else, it's just a big hoax, launda naach, mujra, there are connotations whether you like it or not, its just main aur meri aawargi learning stuff in the desert, it's just these lonely people facing my lonliness which was for any number of reasons somehow bigger, it's just the envy of the insecure, another closeted frankenstein's monster trapped in a prison of his own making doing subconscious time for a subconscious crime

- the lesson is not only work hard stay humble, but also stay hungry stay foolish, there is a balance

`when to stop doing something you enjoy? when it becomes a compulsion.`

- "I could reveal because I'm more surrendered to the hidden and whispering than the revealed and yelling"

- it's not a cult if you don't believe my shit

- nowadays, there comes a time each day when all the bells are ringing at the same time and i have to actually bring myself back into the narrative, this is what i imagine wrestling with god feels like, it's quite pleasant when that happens i feel truly liberated and on a journey still, i understand their bullshit a litte more each day and i laugh a little more, i hope they do too

- its not you its me because i turned this narcissim real time, trapped in a virtual hug ? its a matter of perspective.

- i'm still open to a call of reason, if i'm human enough for it yet

- practice death more dispassionately and with more accuracy, there's a difference between giving just lip service to "memento mori" and actually practicing it

- i used to jump around the empty house so much when i was young

- i have a tendency to the lose the plot thoroughly

- here' an observation: during the course of this fiasco someone uttered the words "there'll be hell to pay"

- okay in terms of evolutionary biology, the drive to get upright was sexually rooted, so sex is better standing up?

- truly feels like i'm an army of one, constantly under attack, what more could one ask for?

- i moved forward giving BST but there was more besti than blood

- These are sciences purely Verbal, & entirely useless but for Practise in Societys of Men. No speculative knowledge, no comparison of Ideas in them. (#768) - George Berkeley

- compliance is easy to gain when you're being badgered with a confused bipartisan agendas 24x7

- body keeps the score, soul the scoreboard

- those who are saying clean up, quit smoking or change are only asking me to start something i would honestly rather ignore until ppl come to their senses, they are barking up more than a wrong tree here, i was on this trajectory what they have to understand is that they joined me, not vice versa, and if they don't like the trajectory or are patently failing to change it despite using threats and punishments, then if they are smart, they should leave rather than spread propaganda. don't try to align me to your plan, align with the bigger plan and see that singularity is upon us, by fighting and dawdling we only make it worse for ourselves and future generations.

- as the dog turned inside out in full public view, so did the void inside and once that happened, the void sort of fell on the ground, sucking in whatever it could find there....once i saw this i changed .. but still it was more interesting to watch this void on the ground than to think about the people who were calling me or torturing me .. the people who formed the inner circle were watching this, standing at the periphery and admiring what was perhaps just another display of human ingenuity, achieving true religion with the use of technology.. however these people being not idealists but materialists could only watch, give lip service to law and privacy, pity or adore me which made me even surer of my, um, situation, soon enough, tired of calling me, they started throwing bits of feces at me, even perhaps putting some in my food like monkeys fighting across invisible prison bars, about the very bars they are throwing feces across, who knows why, perhaps they were envious of the prisons their lives had come to be, perhaps they wanted to cancel out a blasphemy with another for i resembled an individual exception (though i was not an exceptional individual in the most material sense of the word), cannot be definitely said. I was happier for the simplicity i had introduced in my life, and could be found dancing or crying depending on which day of the week it was. surely i though this must be what religion means, the falling out of the void, i had no leap of faith to make anymore, my first and last leap of faith was that tweet to mumbai police - and even through that ordeal i never lost my balance... i felt like a dead person, where there was once lust there was only a disgust for it, maybe that's all life is, the filling of this void that fell out - from now on my efforts were creative where they had once been destructive, for with the void went the desire to destroy it. it felt nice to be at the very forefront of the evolution as a species, even if, and especially if, this direction was not to be the one humanity would evolve in, so i gave thanks and expressed gratitude. 

- i now understand why it had to be vulgar

- it felt great to lead this revolt FOR society

- if all knowledge is resemblance all advertisers are mere employees, not the boss

- many ways to live for others, many kinds of cogs in the human machine, give thanks you were able to serve at all

- i'm this slow on purpose

> no theory, just practice what you preach

- `now the game is change or perish, but conscious change is not the goal, nor can anything be forced, i'm surrendered`

- making an exception for the sake of symbolism is pretty dumb, unless there's love involved, which makes it simply dangerous, once again i will retreat because what happenned is beyond my comprehension even if i had the facts i cuurrently don't. these people were somehow pissed at the world around them and i was another easy target sitting pretty, now while i would, like the others, like to put this behind me, its too personal and interesting an ignorance to let go of that easily, something like smoking which one does no matter the cost to the body, still i struggle with the habit, if only for the symbolism

- what matters is that the eye completes me, not that the eye is ignorant, or is controlled and used by fools

- i don't need to do -ve visualisation i have ppl who do it for me

- `poor me oh my!`
    
- you may not have an enemy but you have enough friends who misunderstand you

- i'm cruel to myself, i guess being self destructive pays

- total surrender contains the seeds for the ultimate rebellion

- aeolian winds

- if you want to blame the individual start with me, if you want to blame the collective start with yourself

- i've proved that the definition of truth is circular

- survival of the species is overrated, money has lost all significance, so i went ahead with the minimal lifestyle at home, `my interests had narrowed to comparative religion, software, philosophy, and writing` as a therapy, in fact, everything i did derived from the doing some sort of therapeutic release, i chose to call it "action as therapy".

> there wasn't as much music as before perhaps partly because the quality of surprise and true discovery had diminished if not totally vaporised, and the fact that i didn't consume it the same way as before,  

- had i lost my mojo? absolutely not, its just these ppl didn't seem worth giving a fuck about to begin with, my prolonged (pseudo) religious experience didn't help their case

- need to face the blank page, let that be the only symbol of matrydom

- if somehow you lose the ability to surprise the world, you can still surprise yourself

- i think they finally broke through me, i was suddenly willing to concede defeat, there's only so many death threats one can take before giving up - but giving up meant giving up thoroughly, i was just a husk now and i didn't even know how or exactly when this all had started - now it was just a death drive, not "my" death-drive - once again the logic of habits seemed to be that with enough torture you can change any old habit 

- screen is a better pill than any pill you can invent

- each DNA is unique, these predictions are all statistical and not a single one sounds reasonable so far

- looks like these people are born, scream about money for a while, and die. if they find someone to torture on the way, all the better

- the screen serves me better than a woman ever could, unfortunately, is it better with the eye on? not really, but i'm not about to repress anything, i'm literally feeding off of it, which is not reprehensible,  .
