## üåµ letters from uncle sam

Dear Dead Tantrik,



I am watching you still. And I see nothing but a self-serving moron, much like your father who is known only for muddying the waters until I cannot even begin to fathom the depths of the insanity of people these days.  I guess the asshole doesn't fall that far.



How does it feel? You're eating shit and playing at corruption thinking that it is "healing‚Äù that you do‚Ä¶. I see no healing being done, I only see war being substituted for war, hatred being replaced with hatred and the passive aggression you seem to have mixed into the mess is leaving everyone less and less satisfied as time passes.



I hate you and I wish you were dead. 

I wish I was dead.







Dear Dead Tantrik,



You wrote in your last correspondence that there is a thin line between stupidity and bravery that I don't seem to recognise. But there are too many lines for me to recognise, such as the one that can be traced over the hatred, jealousy and anger you seem to have plotted into existence and dragged with you over these past years. Out of thin air too, boy!



You said I was in need for a new face, which was especially upsetting. Yet I shall reserve my wrath for a rainy day, for not everyone is "running on empty‚Äù, as you're so fond of saying.



You accuse me of being an old man with one foot in the grave and the other in a graveyard, you threaten and terrorize my people with such utterly profound rank ridiculousness and religious propaganda expecting me to do what exactly? Pay you? Feed your scrawny ass? Clothe you and keep you employed doing who knows what up in that cave of yours? 



And what about where you are from? What kind of place is that exactly? Isn't it a land of magicians, thugs, and con artists? 





DEAR DEAD TANTRIK,



I CANNOT VOUCH FOR THE PEOPLE YOU'RE PLAYING DUMB GAMES WITH BUT I CAN SAY THEY HAVE A SYSTEM, GOOD OR BAD, MAYBE YOU NEED TO CONSIDER THAT IT WORKS FOR THEM? BEFORE THEY CONSIDER HOW YOUR SYSTEM WORKS FOR YOU



I DO THINK IT WOULD BE BEST FOR YOU TO REMAIN CELIBATE, I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S SAFE EITHER, BUT YOU WILL AVOID A LOT OF PAIN. UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY HAVE IT IN FOR YOU, YOU CANNOT WIN. START FROM THERE



KNOW THAT SOMEBODY'S BEEN LETTING OUT BAD VIBES AND RUMORS ABOUT YOU, AND NOT WITHOUT MOTIVE



MAYBE ANGER IS THEIR SIN, I HAVE NO CLUE BUT I KNOW FOR A  FACT YOU'RE STUPID



WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

DEAR DEAD TANTRIK,



HOW'S IT BEEN GOING? I CAN SEE YOU ARE STILL POOR, AND STILL FORCING ME TO SHAME YOU INTO SOME FORM BASIC HUMILITY AND CLOAK YOU.

YOU ARE NOTHING BUT DEAD WEIGHT TO ME. HEY LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER TO THE DARK SIDE, ALL THE CUCKOLDRY YOU CAN AFFORD, I PROMISE. LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE CAN I PROMISE, OH YES, A BULLET EXACTLY WHERE CLAIM TO BE "TOUCHED‚Äù WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.
