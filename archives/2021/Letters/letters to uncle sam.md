## ☀️ letters to uncle sam

Dear Uncle Sam,

So your people threaten me with death and you curse me from breakfast till bed, I hear rumblings about 9/11 being an inside job (whatever that means) and I hear you blame me and my family for simply existing?

Man, get a grip.

All I see is desert as far as my very limited vision allows and as parched as I am, I see no water to drink but lots of oil. Not a single free soul let alone a brave one. So I wonder what you have planned for the future of your generations?

More war? More strife? More debt? More Oil?

Meanwhile the Joe Biden interregnum continues like anybody's business, the rich get richer while poor get sicker.

If I were a communist, I would ask "what is to be done?", but the logic of late capitalism seems to ask only "what is to be expected?", and frankly what I expect is more racism, more hatred, more envy, for the engine of your decay runs on some kind of negativity, some kind of pernicious fear that inspires only envy and hatred of the other. 

I pay through the nose for the mere hint of a suggestion that it doesn't have to be this way.

I used to sleep a sound, dreamless sleep before you showed up at my doorstep, now every night is disturbed if not disturbing for my subconscious has started registering the effects of this subterranean gag order.


I used to eat and live a carefree life now I wonder if the next morsel of food will be my last, surely nobody deserves this and I am left asking why me?


You talk about people not being satisfied and I ask, will they be happy once I am gone? Or will they just simply move on to the next hole to drill?

I don't think you want to be healed, nor do I think you are truly serious about dying, no, you just want to tend infinitely to the festering wounds of history and make the world an accomplice in the perpetual loop of cowardice.




Hey,

so your death drive as more boring than i thought

kthxbye



Dear Uncle Sam,

Like my granny always used to say, we must be wary of those we pity. See, I'm the kind of person that believes enlightenment is an event big enough, and important enough to be planned for over a few lifetimes, so i did, and i dedicated half a chapter to you.

To the anger you try to seed in me but fail repeatedly, to the relationship you want but I don't. Hey I really wish you would stop with the toxicity and the narcissism. I don't remember obliging you with the resposibility to keep me employed or "feed me" sir.

You hate me because you hate all empire builders, for you were once yourself one, but my empire is beyond the realm of your understanding, so man, heed my words and quit before I put you to any more shame on a global stage.

Whom have you ever convinced that wasn't already sold? You should aim for the irrelevance you deserve and stop smelling my farts.

As for your people, some of them almost convince me to commit suicide every day, but like you, they are also failures, and they are creating a future for you which, despite my perch, saddens me to no end. Hey listen, I needed but an excuse to write, so thanks, this is some excuse.
 
Your general populace is not even stupid, retarded, racist, insular and selfish, but also cowardly and narrow minded enough to put future of your future generations into jeopardy and in harm's way, which they have done yet again, but this time it's really different. 

To these people who I found lacking in basic human empathy, and who for me, will always represent the basest negativity, fear, and greed of the white culture, I dedicate my eternal silence and a lifelong committment to never mate, marry, or reproduce, thereby cursing you and yours to suffer exactly the fate you brought upon me and my family for no reason other than you were jealous of my freedom and brevity.

I was a bit of a philosopher and antinatalist to start with, but your lot brought further creedence to my convictions that it isn't a good idea to bring new life and promote the general dumbing down of everything. And should your incompetent citizens try to steal my sperm by any means, they will find that they have compounded the curse seventy fold.

I don't envy you old man, but I can understand why you envy me. Ever seen the envious succeed? No, You will be brushed under the carpet of history so hard, the British will be once again become proud of their colonial past. And I am working on becoming that carpet. 

Good luck,
SS


Dear Uncle Sam,

I get it, I'm stupid, but I can still teach you how to wind an operation down.
Your whole logic seems to go against the grain and against the tide, in certain matters it doesn't pay to be the salmon, especially when facing crises of meaning and #leadership, it pays to be the tuna.

If by accident I have become the ocean in which you swim and you don't like it, you can gradually withdraw from this infinite theather, but you're old and maybe don't want to see the shore again, that's okay too. 

My big idea is that I am ground zero for technological singularity, if I wasn't, then why would I say it? But why take that risk? I'll help you understand why, someday. Maybe then you can stop pretending this is a fallout shelter in an apocalypse.

It's not that I'm special or ahead, your people have failed to evolve fully as humans beings due to all the capitalism and Trump was a symptom of this arrested evolution (that I now epitomise) but it is way too early before your cup runneth over, that much I know. If only that much.

Ever since I can remember, their competitveness was born out of a desire to either follow blindly or out of spite, their attack on me led to the invention of a tech for which they lack a social context, historical bearings and are spiritually bankrupt enough to run wild with it, hurting theselves and others in the process. A stupidity whose time had come, but take a look at the context and you see things are far from the apocalypse this deserves to be.

Not realizing that they're opressed and loose, perhaps because you've more than made up  for your deadbeat ass with the illusion of choice (of fathers). Blindly substituing one mode of opression for the next. Look, I can best make a D student out of an F student, but unlike my mentor, I cannot cook something fat or tasty from this raw material.

I can just as easily make the context conducive to more risk, but the fog evades diagnosis, and indeed war is born in the solipsism of little minds.

It isn't sad or anything from where I stand, and if it is sad, then I think there's more to the picture than meets the eye, for this doesn't seem to be worthy of your sadness, or mine. 

Meanwhile, here, have some more of that Sunday brand indifference.

P.S. Tell Rosie the Riveter to back the fuck off before I make it worse.

Good luck,
SS


Dear Uncle Sam,

There is a difference between us, and the difference is, my coffin is bigger. But don't get your hopes up, i'm just a talentless hack and an ego maniac like the rest, but somehow talented and also risen.
