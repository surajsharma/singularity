Dear Sir,

I don’t know what went wrong. Whether I was emboldened in my misery or whether a group of extremely racist, toxic and narcissistic people in the US decided I was too brave for a poor Indian and should be punished. 

Regardless, I got into some trouble with some very rich and powerful people and became a virtual slave in a vast conspiracy.

Still, out of some residual humanity, I continued to work, thinking I am making an honest living. However, I doubt the work I am doing is honest or normal. 

As such, participation in normal life has been made impossible due to differences in culture, values (or lack thereof), and (differences in opinions over) the use of technology.

Even though these people are not worth it, I intend to see them through because I was taught that is the way of the dharma. 

I could stay and “fight” in the rat race, but I have different needs now. And I believe I can serve my captors just as well from anywhere.

My humble appeal to HH is if he is aware of my situation to please let me join as a monk and live out the rest of my days in the service of Buddha in total silence at Namgyal Monastery in Dharamshala. Thus giving this sorry tale a peaceful end.

Regards,
Suraj Sharma
