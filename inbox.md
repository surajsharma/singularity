## life isn't protocol, but any diplomatic effort in the name of greater peace is almost entirely protocol. in it's entirety, the movement from birth to death cannot be accurately portrayed by language which is a subset of life, that's hegel 101. there's no such thing as pure unadulterated truth. perhaps the only pure truth is mortality, the rest is narrative courtesy of your DNA and the envioronment. seems obvious when you think about it, but the obvious is a great hiding place.

## invitations disguised as challenges suck, there are people out there that don't take challenges from outside, i'm one of those.

## life is grand opera, anything less is a compromise, no wonder they hate 

## i had better prayers and muses, export-quality dreams, so guess what i did?

## the thread of consciousness is connected all the way back to its origin, consciousness IS the middleman, negotiate your own freedom

## one afternoon, whilst i sat miking my favorite cow, the neighbours came and encircled me in absolute silence, now i know why

## i eliminated choice itself, rationality was far behind now

## marxism summarised: `history is what you CHOOSE to remember, usually the stories of those who won because you are programmed to by their decsendents and those who profited from winning. this makes history a prize worth killing for, to me it was not more what i chose to remember in the last 5 minutes`, and not because i was not interested in winning at all, decades of received failure will teach you to keep a low profile - but my ego and vanity were unabashed and who doesn't want $20?. however, usually `those who win are called the "rich", this creates class struggle`. although it needn't, but the poor are equally greedy. but upon seeing the class struggle, i had to decide if i wanted to exploit my somewhat unique status amongst the "rich" - `the central friction in the state of play was my reluctance to get involved. who could deny me my reasons?` on top of that, my choice was not an explicit ask by a physical presence of those asking me to do myself and them a favor, but totally a manipulative, narcissistic double bind, a bomb not worth diffusing so i stepped aside. these people came seeking a theater, so decided to give them one, they came back for more, so i gave two. `i haven't heard from them in the past 10 minutes`.

## they came bearing electric toothbrushes and promises of jetpacks

## i'm no saint for sure, but the ecstasy is just as real

## OSHO is a shapeshifter, he can inflate himself to be bigger than he is, something few can pull off, this makes people jealous

## one of the main discerments in any spiritual life is to not confuse the frontend for the backend, it is middlemen all the way until the source, although rare middlemen represent what they bring clearly enough to be labelled themselves god, thats ok. people doing god's work surely deserve the nameplate, but the person is not the nameplate.

## violence is how winning is done, and i hadn't the heart for it, much preferred to play the victim,if only to sooth hurt egos

## if you want to end up at 99, you must first be 100

## your salvation is SO not my problem, work it out on your own. it is a problem i've been taught to want, while in truth working out my own is a job enough. work on the problem you have, not the problem you want to have #mentalmodels

## in the end, only kindness matters

## given the option between choosing a position in which neither i nor the race-minded come off as cowards, and one where i come off as a coward, i will probably pussy out - not only because of the mythical angle but also because i was quite thoroughly turned off by the whole concept of marriage, not to mention the excessive gatekeeping (even for a myth, things went beyond tribal), and a friendship for sex's sake didn't exactly seem worth it. i was a lone wolf at heart and thus preferred to stick to this core fact. a hippy-dippy pretend suburban marriage sponsored by anyone seemed a wholly repugnant idea. especially when the fruits of solitude had just begun to ripen.


## i told them i've been writing billy joel's songs but they didn't believe


## learn pain management from the blind, nightmare management from us

## if you found god would you want to play a finite game with him?
