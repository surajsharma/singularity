Existential Rationalism: Handling Hume's Fork - Eschauzier, Marcel (Highlight: 67; Note: 0) ─────────────── 

◆ Existential Rationalism: Handling Hume's Fork ▪ The desire to transcend conceals the truth. 

◆ 1. The original story of existential rationalism ▪ Hume shatters our hope of having certainty about anything that exists in the world 

▪ Alan Watts (1915-1973) very instructive. He explains the essence of Oriental philosophy with British articulateness so that my Occidental mind could get it. 

▪ my search was the answer. 

▪ epistemological (meaning knowledge-theory related ) aspect of satori, in broad strokes, is the insight that we cannot know reality at all because we are part of it. ▪ Satori implies abandoning the hope to discover reality. 

▪ quantum computer is a concrete example: it is the perpetual motion machine of our time. 

▪ any attempt to describe reality is futile. 

▪ reality implies a separation from the conscious mind. 

▪ assumption that there is objective knowledge beyond experience to be found. 

▪ it is irrational to claim that we can know reality because no mind can wrap itself completely around something it is part of. 

▪ We don’t look at reality but through it 

▪ Reality must remain a mystery, albeit a familiar one. 

▪ Western thought is inherently dualistic this way: 

▪ Truth is essential in our lives, but it resides in our being, not beyond it. 

▪ Dualism provides an alibi for philosophical timidity 

▪ evidence-based science has brought us a long way: it should continue to be cherished 

▪ it can only falsify and not provide positive guidance 

 We haven’t yet acknowledged we are part and parcel of a single world. ▪

 What is missing in Western thought is a rational consideration of subjective consciousness ▪ widespread belief in the promise of quantum computers is startingly irrational 

◆ 2. Rationalism, again 

▪ Existential doubt calls for truthful existential answers. What could such an answer look like? An idea, a feeling, a belief, or even a person? 

▪ The belief in an external world independent of the observing subject lies at the foundation of all natural science 

▪ is it possible to obtain any objective knowledge at all? 

▪ rational people must agree that it is equally irrational not to dare to challenge assumptions 

▪ It is not heretical to have an open mind. 

▪ belief in objective knowledge implies that we can know something about what exists independently of people 

▪ existence precedes the distinction of truth by consciousness 

▪ Viewing consciousness as not separate from the rest of the world has a long tradition in Eastern thinking 

▪ perceived separation from reality is an illusion 

▪ Looking for existential clarity outside of ourselves is more prevalent in the West and the Islamic world 

▪ all knowledge humanity will ever be able to collect is knowledge of experience . 

▪ People may look for ways to find agreement based on individual truths. If they are successful, they might speak of shared truth 

▪ The dualistic way of thinking has been spectacularly successful 

▪ Just because a notion is successful doesn’t mean it is true. 

▪ Experiment, even when scientifically replicable, is still a form of perception. 

▪ Western thinking has lost touch with human experience in almost schizophrenic self-denial 

▪ Objective knowledge requires a conceptual, third-person view of the world, but nobody has ever met a “third person.” 

▪ Western world has forgotten what being truly rational means 

▪ Could it be that an update of the Western way of thinking is required? 

▪ It helps to revitalize some principles of 18th-century rational thought 

▪ rationalism and empiricism are rooted in phenomenal experience 

▪ Contemporary Western thinking is under the spell of an existential illusion 

▪ reality cannot be caught 

▪ rationality’s premise doesn’t need to be a dualistic belief in higher truth 

▪ Improved existential understanding allows, even demands , conceptual rigor to coexist with enlightenment 

▪ scientific method leads to rational knowledge, not objective knowledge 
▪ reason can also help find a consensus where the scientific method doesn’t apply 

▪ Existential rationalism isn’t the West’s first “subjective” philosophy, but it seeks to be a more comprehensive one 
▪ Hume’s challenge to rationalism is finally met 
▪ inevitable conclusion is that quantum computers will never actually compute 

▪ Alchemy was a boon for chemistry, but it could not make gold out of lead. 

▪ Humanity doesn’t play a zero-sum game 

◆ 3. What is experience? 

▪ Internal medicine recognizes that the sleeping mind is not the same as the unconscious mind 

▪ One cannot be conscious of something and not experience it

 ▪ blindsight 

▪ experience is always phenomenal. Experience is identical to the conscious mind, and it imagines the hypothetical experiences of concepts, for itself, as its sole product. 

▪ There is no reality in the vibrations of air molecules that produce sound or the lack of water in the blood that causes thirst 



◆ 4. What is knowledge? 

▪ law of identity of indiscernibles clarifies that two entities with different names that share all properties are actually a single entity 

▪ Since the conscious mind is an inseparable element of reality, it doesn’t reflect reality but what it is like to participate in reality 

▪ Seeing is a real experience, but what it sees is not real 

▪ Vision is but one of the countless aspects of the phenomenal experience. The closer I pay attention to the visual experience, the more I notice that I cannot see it separate from the rest of the phenomenal experience 

▪ True, false, fictional, or transcendent: it doesn’t matter; concepts are products of the conscious mind, so abstractions of experience 

▪ Ontic knowledge is not knowledge of reality but the knowledge that is the real experience of participating in reality. 

▪ The key is understanding that concepts are imaginations of the conscious mind 

▪ Present immediacy essentially defines the ontic knowledge of phenomenal experience. This condition has a consequence: all phenomenal experience must be private

 ▪ The subject who has the experience is no longer our first-person conscious mind, but an imagined “other person,” possibly a projection of our conscious mind in the past or future.
