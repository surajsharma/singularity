Sometimes you decide before doing
Other times you decide after doing
Knowing which kind of decision you face is key.

> Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don't we want to go, and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how to fail instead - through sloth, envy, resentment, self-pity, entitlement, all the mental habits of self-defeat. Avoid these qualities and you will succeed. Tell me where I'm going to die, that is, so I don't go there. - Charlie Munger

> “It's not greed that drives the world, but envy.” - charlie munger

"Freedom is precisely the state of not having to choose
Choice is not a form of freedom
Choice is the act of hesitation that we make before making a decision, it is a mental wobbling.

## 3 Heuristics For DM
- If you cannot decide, the answer is no
- Take the path more difficult in the short term
- Make the choice that leaves you more equanimous / AT PEACE, not necessarily status quo

A spiritual way out (at least in personal matters)
 
Listen to both/all sides

‘repetition [...] is a task for free- dom, [...] it signifies freedom itself, consciousness raised to the second power’.


negative reactions are generally more conditioned than positive ones, but due to ego "positive" gets negative connotations, so i aim for a "lukewarm" mix of considered, wistful melancholy in my decision making
