Never judge anyone, ever.



Let yourself be persecuted, but do not persecute others.



Be crucified, but do not crucify others.



Be slandered, but do not slander others.



Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep:   such is the sign of purity.



Suffer with the sick.



Be afflicted with sinners.



Exult with those who repent…



…Rebuke no one, revile no one, not even those who live very wickedly.



Spread your cloak over those who fall into sin, each and every one, and shield them.



St. Isaac of Syria
