adhyatma - adhidaiva - adhibhuta
It does not mean that God is sitting far away from ourselves and from the world because the principle of divinity we call God, the transcendent element, is hiddenly present on both the sides of experience—the subjective adhyatma and the objective adhibhauta—in such a manner that in bringing about an organic connection between the two terms, the subjective and the objective, the individual and the world, it not only constitutes the very stuff of the world and the stuff of the individual, but ranges far above both these principles.
