Sages have no mind of their own 
their mind is the mind of the people 
to the good they are good 
to the bad they are good 
until they become good 
to the true they are true 
to the false they are true 
until they become true . . .





There is no need to run outside 
For better seeing, 
Nor to peer from a window. Rather abide 
At the center of your being; 
For the more you leave it, the less you learn.
