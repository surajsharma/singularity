Life is matter's spiritual gym.

Wrap this around your gin addled brains, i am "together” with no one on this, each person to themselves is a utopia so i accept i am highlighted against a mob, which makes it all the more important to stand up as an individual, no matter the cost.



While 



 is the goal now more than ever, there are questions of timing, logistics, preparation and most importantly, the collapse of the conspiracy - for if the bubble never bursts, it might not make sense to disturb established practice.



But if it does, things could be so much easier. 



The difference is you are still philosophising, still stuck on developing a deploying a philosophy while I, having perfected my vision, have already started moving in the spiritual, which you will never understand so your only option is violence.





Life is matter's spiritual gym.
