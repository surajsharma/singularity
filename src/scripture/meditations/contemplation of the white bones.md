his navel, it enters his coccyx. After entering his coccyx, it disappears. With 
its disappearance, there immediately appears a spontaneously arising great 
cloud of light.It is adorned with jewels and pure jewel-flowers more exquisite than all other material forms. Within the cloud is a buddha named Śākyamuni, replete in radiance, endowed with the thirty-two major and 
eighty minor marks, each one radiating a thousand lights. These lights are 
extremely bright, blazing forth like a hundred thousand million suns. This 
buddha preaches the teaching of the four truths. His light dazzling, he stands  
before the practitioner and lays his hand upon his head. (Chan Essentials 2.20.9–10)
