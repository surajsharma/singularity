# The Slave

    > my vision of the new man is of a rebel, of a man who is in search of his original self, of his original face. a man who is ready to drop all masks, all pretensions, all hypocrisies, and show the world what he, in reality is. whether he is loved or condemned, respected, honored or dishonored, crowned or crucified, does not matter; because to be yourself is the greatest blessing in existence. even if you are crucified, you will be crucified fulfilled and immensely contended. a man of truth, a man of sincereity, a man who understands that people are blind, unconcious,asleep, spiritually asleep.


    > just be yourself, then there's no misery, no competition and no bothetation that others have more

    > i never allowed anybody to distract me 

    > the priest will die if you learn to love yourself, the politician will not have followers; all the vested interests in society will go bankrupt- they are thriving on a very subtle psychological  exploitation of you

    > one thing is basic in that manipulation, that is, don't love yourself:hate, yourself because you are not worth anything     

    > Altruism can only be a by product of self-love

    > The problem becomes complicated because the people he has to protect himself against are the people think that they love him. And perhaps they are not lying. Their intentions are good but their consciousness is missing; they are fast asleep. They don't know that they are being puppets in the hands of a blind force called the society, the establishment - all the vested interests are together.

    > It is strange that the people who love him don't love him as he is. They say to him "we will love you, we do love you, but only if you follow the religion we are following, if you become obidient the way we are obedient"

    > Disobedience is the original sin - and then society takes revenge with great vengeance. This creates fear...

    > They are also unconscious, your parents, your teachers -- don't be angry with them. They are also victims like you.

    >  The serpent was humanity's first friend - but he is condemned

    > it is because of the serpent that you have become what you have become..because of disobedience to god that you have attained a certain dignity

    > Drop all goals. Drop the very Idea of future.


# The Son

    > the virgin mary replied, "frankly, we were hoping he would be a doctor"... parents are always hoping and their hope becomes poisonous

    > your destiny is to become an end in yourself

    > if you become too attached to your mother you will not be able to find your beloved

    > the mother is your source, if you start flowing towards her, you are going upstream 

    > love for mother has to be more like, gratitude, deep respect, prayerful, less like love

    > if you go away, go, but touch the feet of your mother and father
 

# The Robot

    > just watch yourself, EVEN TO THE VERY POINT OF DEATH PEOPLE GO ON REPEATING OLD HABITUAL patterns
    
    > response is spontaneous, reaction is just old habit ... 99%of your acts are mechanical reactions
    
    > just watch yourself
    
    > do something ABSOLUTELY new that you have never done before
    
    > action is beautiful, reaction is ugly 


# The Animal

    > man can be far lower than animals, man can be far higher than gods, that is the freedom and danger, the agony and ecstasy of man
    
    > the more the energy is converted into love, the less and less need for sex will be there, but you will not hate it
    
    > unless you meditate deeply, you will not be able to transcend your sexual craziness
    
    >  instead of finding a beautiful woman, start creating a beautiful man within you
    rather than finding a graceful woman, your energy can make you graceful
    
# The Sex Maniac

    > sex is transcended not by any effort on your part. if you make an effort, it will be repressive
    
    > when repression happens, side-by-side, opression also happens
    
    > whenever you are repressed, you start finding a perversed interest
    
    > people who transcend sex are people who accept it naturally
    
    > get rid of the priest within you, then you will see that porn has disappeared
    
    > it makes no difference where you are, enlightenment is always at a constant distance of one step
    
    > enlightenment becomes easier when you are playing a role which you do not like
    
    > the ordinary sexual orgasm looks like madness; the tantric orgasm is a deep, relaxing meditation

# The Monk

> man is always exploited through fear

> the greatest way to create fear is to make man feel guilty about natural things, he cannot drop them, and he cannot enjoy them because of fear of hell, so he is in a double bind. The double bind is the base of man's exploitation


# The Beggar

> respect simply means looking again, re-spect

> what do they want? they are beggars, you should not be angry with them because that is what they want. you should not condemn them because that is what they want
