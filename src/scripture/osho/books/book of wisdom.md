# examine the nature of unborn awareness

- let even the remedy itself go, no more examination, no more remembering that all is dream 

- all is phenomenon, that which can be seen/experienced is a dream, all phenomenon are dreams

- posess anything and you are possessed by it, even a meditation technique

- ego is a by product of the illusion that whatsoever your seeing is true, if you think continuously all is a dream, suddenly in a dream you will remember that this is a dream too... and you will see your dream disappearing

- all minds are idiots, origin of idiocy means something private, something special, something of your own, something eccentric, mind always functions in an eccentric way, intelligence arises out of no mind

> mind always needs props, it cannot live without them

- you can drop only a method that you have used

- sannyas is nothing but `a closing of doors`

- sannyas is just a gesture from your side that yes understanding has dawned

- becoming a sanyassin simply means you have declared your freedom

- the real master will always disappoint you, he has to

- sannyas is to undo what the society has done
