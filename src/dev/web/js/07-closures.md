## Closures

### What is a closure?

- ___closure: a function along with a reference to the environment in which it is created.___

- Closures allow a nested function to access the declarations inside the containing functio

### How do closures work?

- once again briefly go over how the [lexical scope](05-scope#lexical-scope) is resolved.

### How are different scopes linked?

- At this point, we know how the scope is resolved, and the different scopes are linked together, forming a chain that is known as the __"scope chain."__ But have you wondered how different scopes are linked?

### What causes this problem?

### How to resolve this problem?

### How are objects linked?	Prototypes

### The `prototype` property

### Getting prototype of any object

### `Object.prototype` - parent of all objects

### `Function` function

### Problems with `__proto__`

### `Object.create` method

### `Null` prototype object	

### ES2015 classes
