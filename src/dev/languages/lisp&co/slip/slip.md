# Slip

## Yet another lisp?


The whole idea of writing yet another lisp in C is frankly boring and does not help me get out of bed in the morning.


I need an edge, even if I am to write the most basic compiler one that does one thing OKAY


It is only a matter of time before I will pick Rust up anyway, so why not with this.


Going by the general [guide](https://buildyourownlisp.com/contents), there isn't much to go by on [[optimizations]]


Ideally it would nice to have some kind of optimization 


I have a choice whether to follow the guide and then port the code to Rust, or simply port it - without writing at all.
