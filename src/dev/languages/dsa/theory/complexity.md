These are the most commonly used classifications for order of magnitude in big O notation, sorted from the best (most efficient) to worst (least efficient):

    - Constant time 
    - Logarithmic time
    - Linear time
    - Log-linear time
    - Quadratic time
    - Cubic time
    - Exponential time

Each order of magnitude describes an algorithmâ€™s time complexity. `Time complexity is the maximum number of steps an algorithm takes to complete as n (input) gets larger.`
