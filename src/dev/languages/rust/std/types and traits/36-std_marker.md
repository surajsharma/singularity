/* In Rust's standard library, a marker trait is a special kind 
of trait that is used to indicate certain properties or behaviors 
of types without requiring any methods to be implemented. Marker 
traits do not define any functionality; instead, they serve as a 
way to communicate information to the Rust compiler or to other 
developers about the types that implement them.

For example:

Send: A marker trait that indicates that a type can be safely 
transferred between threads.

Sync: A marker trait that indicates that a type can be safely 
shared between threads.

In essence, marker traits are a way to tag types with specific properties 
or capabilities, enabling the compiler to make certain assumptions or 
enforce certain rules about them.

Key points about markers:

They have no runtime cost since they occupy no space.
They are used to implement compile-time checks and constraints.
Common examples include Send, Sync, and PhantomData.
They can be used to indicate thread-safety, ownership, or other properties of types.
Markers help in creating safer and more expressive APIs.

Markers are a powerful feature in Rust for adding compile-time guarantees 
and improving type safety without runtime overhead.

use std::marker::PhantomData;

/* 	PhantomData is used when defining generic
 *	types that do not logically contain data of a certain type, 
 *	but need to be associated with it for type checking purposes
 * 	PhantomData is typically used when you want to express that a 
 *	type logically contains data of type T, even though it doesn't 
 *	actually store this data. It's often used for type-level 
 *	bookkeeping.
