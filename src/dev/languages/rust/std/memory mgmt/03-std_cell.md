```rust

/* 	The std::cell module in Rust provides functionality for mutable
	memory locations that can be modified through shared references,
	using types like Cell and RefCell. This is useful in situations where
	you need interior mutability.
	
	These operations are safe even when multiple references to the 
	cell exist, making it a useful tool for managing shared mutable
	state in a controlled manner without violating Rust's borrowing
	rules.
*/

use std::cell::Cell;

fn main() {
	let cell = Cell::new(5);
	println!("Initial value: {}", cell.get());
	cell.set(10);
	println!("Updated value: {}", cell.get());
