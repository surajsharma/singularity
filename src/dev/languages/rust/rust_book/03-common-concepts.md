## Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts 
### Variables and Mutability 
#### Constants 

- Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared. 

- `const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;`

#### Shadowing 

### Data Types 
- Rust is a statically typed language 

- compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

- In cases when many types are possible, such as when we converted a String to a numeric type using parse in [[02-guessing-game]], we must add a type annotation
  - ```let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");```

#### Scalar Types [int, float, char, bool]

- Integer Overflow 
  - `debug` builds check for it
  - `release` builds wrap around
  - for explicit checking see `wrapping_*`, `checked_*`, `overflowing_*`, `saturating_*` families of methods

#### Compound Types [tuple, array]
### Functions 
#### Parameters 
#### Statements and Expressions 
#### Functions with Return Values 
### Comments 
### Control Flow 
#### if Expressions 
#### Repetition with Loops
