## Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts 
### Variables and Mutability 
#### Constants 

- Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in which they were declared. 

- `const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;`

### Data Types 
- Rust is a statically typed language 

- compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.

- In cases when many types are possible, such as when we converted a String to a numeric type using parse in [[02-guessing-game]], we must add a type annotation
  - ```let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");```

#### Scalar Types [int, float, char, bool]

- Integer Overflow 
  - `debug` builds check for it

  - `release` builds wrap around

  - for explicit checking see `wrapping_*`, `checked_*`, `overflowing_*`, `saturating_*` families of methods

- Unicode scalar values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive

#### Compound Types [tuple, array]

- We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses

`let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`

- To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value

```rs 
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("The value of y is: {y}");
```

- We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access. 

```rs
let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let five_hundred = x.0;
let six_point_four = x.1;
let one = x.2;
```

### Control Flow 
#### `loop`
- One of the uses of a loop is to retry an operation you know might fail, 
  - such as checking whether a thread has completed its job 
  - to pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code

```rs
let result = loop {
  counter += 1;
  if counter == 10 {
    break counter * 2;
  }
};
```

#### Loop labels

- If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point. 

- You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop that you can then use with `break` or `continue`

- Loop labels must begin with a single quote. Here’s an example with two nested loops:
  - first `break` that doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. 
  - The `break 'counting_up;` statement will exit the outer loop

```rs 
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;
        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }

            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }
        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

- When `continue` is encountered, the current iteration is terminated, returning control to the loop head, typically continuing with the next iteration.

#### `while`

```rs 
while number != 0 {
  println!("{number}!");
  number -= 1;
}
```


#### `for`

```rs 
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
for element in a {
  println!("the value is: {element}");
}

for number in (1..4).rev() {
  println!("{number}!");
}
```
