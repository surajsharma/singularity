## Propositions


> Definition. A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.


$$
p(n) \mathrel{::=} n^2 + n + 41 
$$

- The symbol WWD means “equal by definition.” It’s always ok simply to write “=” instead of ::=, but reminding the reader that an equality holds by definition can be helpful.

### **In fact, it’s not hard to show that no polynomial with integer coefficients can map all nonnegative numbers into prime numbers, unless it’s a constant**

- > This statement is saying that there's no magic formula using addition, subtraction, and multiplication of whole numbers that can turn every non-negative number (0, 1, 2, 3...) into a prime number.

- > Think of it this way: A polynomial is like a formula where you plug in a number and get another number out. For example, `x² + 2x + 1` is a polynomial. If we wanted this polynomial to always give prime numbers, then no matter what whole number we put in for x, the result would need to be prime.

- > The statement tells us this is impossible unless the polynomial is just a constant (like "5" all by itself).

- > Here's why: If a polynomial isn't constant, it eventually grows larger and larger. As it grows, it will eventually produce numbers that are divisible by other numbers - meaning they can't be prime. For example, if f(n) = n² + n + 41, this gives primes for n = 0 to 39, but f(40) = 40² + 40 + 41 = 1681 = 41², which isn't prime.

- > No matter how clever you are with your polynomial formula, you can't escape this limitation - there will always be some input that produces a non-prime output.

### You can’t check a claim about an infinite set by checking a finite set of its elements, no matter how large the finite set.

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}. \, p(n) \text{ is prime}
$$

> for all n where n is a member of nonnegative integers, p(n) is prime
