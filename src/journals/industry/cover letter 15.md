Hi,

I'm Suraj, a tech generalist currently working as senior full stack developer/devops engineer from north India.

Overall, I've shipped and improved all kinds of products as a developer, such as - high-availability APIs and scalable server-side services  for asset management companies, GDPR compliant white-labelled ed-tech solutions, frontends for microservices/cloud functions, federated open-source tools for socially-aware data collection and classification, and thousands of hits/day retail e-commerce businesses. 

I have helped improve existing codebases, created new products and features as production-ready solutions and led small teams towards successful funding rounds by Y-Combinator.

I've delivered design systems, patentable fronts-ends, cross-browser extensions, and mobile-ready games.

Naturally I have gravitated towards web3, I can write and deploy simple smart contracts on the blockchain.

My experience in government, content and media/financial journalism allows me to communicate effectively across teams and write compelling documentation or white papers, tutorials, and video scripts.

As a patient team player and an innate leader, I am confident that you will find that my hands-on experience, qualifications and skills make me an excellent candidate for this position with you.

I live in, and work from the Himalayas where I spend my spare time learning new tech, and writing aphorisms.
