- whether or not history is just another determination, a higher one unfolding into minutes and seconds is immaterial. even if it is all just memory on a stroll adrift, it is wholly material whether _friction_ of all kinds is minimised through apparent or immanent volition


- entropy is _the_ estate and theater of all production. a lonely lacerating edge that cuts both producer and production, both empire and its constituents. had it been the only duality extant, all experience would last no longer than a burst from a bottle rocket. fortunately, there is another duality at work and each "carrying on" comes attendent with its own "keeping calm".


- it is in digging a new channel that the production of production appears, entelechy and entropy working like two tunnel boring machines digging underwater from either side of the Atlantic, destined to meet not in the middle but wherever the channel completes, and if one of them is faster, that means that much less relevance and credit for the other. seen this way, entropy is actually of great help towards our cause in declaring independence from it.


- to be clear a total exit from extension is also an exit from entelechy, in so far as an ideal end of all idealism isn't an idealism but a meta-ideal unconditioning of ideating agencies.


- in the machinations of diurnal commerce, the achievement of not a _for-giving_, but a _giving-for_ - irrespective of the attendent problems this might bring about, all of which will have logically inferior levels of entropy
