- it is causality which belies the expression of being as a finite, different subject of an infinite, indifferent object. 


- since perceived time is not causa-sui rather a consequence of pure difference (folding upon itself), the self-similarity between two succesive moments is a difference in itself. the superhighway of difference is punctuated with exits in time at self-similar and regular intervals 


- a determined being can thus, break the loop of eternal return to arrive at transcendental memory, which is memory in superposition, a door which opens into pure difference itself. though this journey is so fraught with existential, mythical, and symbolic dangers and fears that few attempt and fewer still arrive at the destination


- transcendental memory is a disembodied phenomenon it isn't a recall of time in the mind but a recall of time outside of any and all minds - in terms of its interface with pure difference, it is the rememberance of forgetting - the realm of all things lost, the kingdom of the imaginary


- Schr√∂dinger's cat is the keychain you misplaced last time until you found it, between the time you lost and found it, it was an artifact in transcendental memory - regardless of how many people saw it lying on the mantle, it was not there until you recalled its coordinates or somehow otherwise chanced upon it - including having someone else find it for you. 


- the way out of difference and into pure difference is a similar recall of something long forgetten, except the thing forgotten is forgetfulness itself


- blind spot of the  "big bang", or a singular entry point of time into substance is therefore a myth perpetuated by parochial and limited scientific foresight, there isn't a single original fold but as many as there are dimensions available for observation, which surely as mathematics confirms, are more than three.


- time is the perforation that marks the borders between one dimension and another, across which extends difference as planes of angularly folded faces of a singular, n-dimensional polyhedra. our observable universe is one such face.


-  the perforation itself is a duality consisting of succession of stiches and gaps between them, the stitch itself is an instance of difference and the cause of memory (difference welded to difference) whereas the gap is an instance of pure difference and the cause of transcendental memory (difference separated from itself)


- a lot could go differently between the disloging of the apple from the tree and it's impact with Newton's head, or between the time a bullet leaves the muzzle to meet its target ... the argument here isn't that causality branches out at each integral step of the way and we only experience but one of the multitudes, but rather that we are reminded of a singularity as opposed to recalling every permutation extant. 


- it is pertinent to discern between causality and continuation - what binds the diurnal nature of being's experience of time isn't a predetermined chain of cause-and-effect, but a determined political economy of continuity that intends to tell a singular story instead of a cacophony of bewildering qualia 


- continuity is linear time, while causality is quadratic hence can have more than a single solution or outcome of any possible eventuality. continuity unfolds at the intersection of time and memory whereas causality is a memory-dependent phenomenon. indeed, there are mental afflictions that result in a loss of faculties to establish causality but only death is the end of continuation.


- another somewhat crude analogy of this difference between causality and continuity could be in the "compression" of time, causality is lossy compression whereas continuity is lossless 


-  transcendental memory is a kind of a break in this encoding, an event within this political economy of time which swallows it as a whole, expressed either as a glut of memory or a bankruptcy of forgetting - causing, in either case,  a grounding of being into the time by way of returning to it every possible recallable event and, as a consequence, a grounding of being into eternal return. into that place referred to in revelation 10-6 where "there shall be time no longer".


- descriptions of such a skip in the recording and ordering of time are conscpicuous by their absence in the annals of human philosophy, including spiritual literature. therfore is ill-understood, and underreported as various states of "enlightenment" such as "nirvana" or "moksha", even though it is a well understood goal of the geist to achieve this state of affairs. 


- the reason why it remains an elusive ideal of spirit to achieve a metasensory understanding is exactly this determined binding of memory into difference. memory as a lossy encoding of difference prohibits any state of omniscience, causing reality to appear as a locally defined, limited expression of the limitless.

- cognitively speaking, the bend, crease, and fold dialectic is directly mapped to cognition, object, and subject. alternatively, it can be stated as the dialectic of the observation, observer, and the observed subject.


- if time was matter, causality would be its density whereas continuity would be its volume 


- we now begin to see how observed time cannot be a finite expression of the infinite, just as any solid, liquid, or gas filling a container cannot express more than the contours of the container will allow it to. in other words, just as all possibilities and probabilities of the life of a rotting wound are already contained within the cauterization, time is the sum of all memories, the sum of all differences in itself.


- exactly which of these probabilities is alotted to observation is a dependent chain of differences leading all the way to the first one. this is the essence of the buddhist doctrine of __pratityasamutpada__ [2]


- this apparent chain of causality is dense locally but at levels of abstraction greater than sensory data allows, the chain grows sparse until both cause and effect cease to exist. 


- this density of time, this inescapable labyrinth of events that dictates our everyday life is a deconstriction decoupled from the actual state of affairs to the point that it appears to ensnare us with it's magnified, exaggerated version the real until we are enslaved to follow it like a perforated page being torn from a diary.


- however, a page being torn from a diary need not necessarily follow the perforation.


- occasionally, albeit rarely and of late increasingly rarely, by acts of omission or commission, by dint of will or chance, a peek is affored into the obverse of time. [3?]


- a leak in memory will obviously lead to transcendental memory, which is a phenomenon unnatural enough to be equated with stepping out, for the first time, of Plato's cave.


- to be clear, there is a difference between the mere existence of an exit on the difference superhighway and the act of taking said exit. usual time does not allow even the observation of the existence of such an exit from time as we rush past it preoccupied with the baggage of all moments preceding. 


- on the rare occassion such an exit is witnessed it gets ignored, or bypassed as a two-bit deviance from the norm - the symptoms of which may include anything between seasonal affective disorder to full blown schitzophrenic attacks. rarer still is the occassion, whereupon one either takes said exit willingly, or is left with no other route - herein not only the destination changes, but the point of original departure changes as well.


- the main idea here is that __pratityasamutpada__ can be raised to the nth degree. dependent origination in a quantum flux.


- the gap between two stitches isn't "real", in the sense that it is an absence of thread, nor is the gap imaginary in the sense that the absence of thread is real and not feigned, what completes the dialectical of a stitch (thread-gap-thread) is precisely this symbolic presence.


-  arriving at this sanctum sanctorum of difference is itself not just emancipatory, but emancipatory to the nth degree - allowing one to live a life free of compromise. however, the elucidation of such a frozen artifact of timlessness and memorylessness is not a function of language, for language is a phenomenon occuring in time - thus it is impossible, to clearly articulate (weather through words, heartbeats or other means) what a being for whom the doors of transcendental memory open witnesses.


- infact, language is the first thing to go out the window and an immediate, irreversible invocation of the Wittgenstenian dictum of "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" suffuses through one's being. Even where one could describe the contents of TM to others, it is generally a good idea to refrain from doing so for the departure from norm is so great that the risk of expression overpowers all urges to aid the fellow cave dwellers.


- how language is invalidated by pure difference is also a rather interesting phenomenon which can be understood with a thought experiment. suppose an interdimensional being visits earth with the intention to marry an earthling who can speak a shibboleth in a language of earth. assuming that the shibboleth signifies something earthlings are familiar with, the ontological gap is such that the challenge quickly devolves into an NP-hard problem and cannot be ascertained in any nondeterministic polynomial time. even with quantum computing, arriving at a single solution seems a likely overreach.

- the curvature of space-time can be said to be a by-product of the local(ly observed) movement of memory in difference - the "universe" is flat. the same process of observation that cause space-time to be curved give rise to such phenomenon as rational numbers. it is no stretch of imagination to say that rational numbers are imaginary just like we can show that imaginary numbers are real [welch labs].


- actually, rational numbers are just quantized natural numbers, quantized for purposes of measurement precise in terms of sense data. at an ontological level, reality is dual i.e. binary. something either exists or it doesn't, and what does exist is not a fraction but a whole.


- what then could it mean to say that being exists (or doesn't)?


- simply stated, being is a whole. a singular synthesis of an objective simulacra that comes "batteries included" with its own simulation. an recursive iteration of pure difference. 


- important to note here is the difference between being as a defined here and Hegel's concept of geist or spirit. Spirit is the metaphysics of being, but being can occur at varying levels of this cognition, such as animals, insects, inanimate objects, cartoons, works of art, artificial intelligence etc. what is sought to be elucidated here is an ontology of being rather than a metaphysics.


- spirit can be reduced to its cognition, but being can only be reduced to pure difference. in linguistic terms, any standalone receptacle of meaning. 


- a single tear born in an eye, rolling down a cheek before finally hitting the linoleum is an underrated example of being. the life of a tear starts before it is born, an adjacence of sheer will disguised as happenstance seems to bring about the watery discharge to fruition. anyone lacking in will cannot start and/or stop crying, similarly, one lacking in will cannot live, die or even be born. 


- but will is a contextual apparition, it has been experimentally proven that will is a finite resource of mental faculties - context has an end conginitively speaking but not continuity. the context of a situation has bearing only on elements in a local range (any event is a local event) whereas continuity can appear to carry it infinitely across time. 


- the debate around abortion across the globe is part of the failure to establish the locus of context, which begs the question of relation between memory and will. the cognitive end of context and the limitlessness of memory cannot be said to be opposing forces, for in that case, it would be possible to live through the symmetry of time, and time-travel would be possible. 


- the ontological reason for impossibility of faster-than-light movement is the impossibility of forgetting...each impression of difference in time, each recall and each repetition leaves behind a trail of consequences, however recorded. in the words of delueze "it takes a lot of memory to forget".


- buried inside such an impossibility of any movement or "will", is its memory. but like time and memory aren't self-willed, nor will is self-created, as stated previously, difference is externally introduced - difference without which it would be impossible to differentiate between one moment and the next. 


- in short, being recalls entropy and re-creates its birth in death in the same way a tear wills itself in the memory of a hurt long gone. 


- the deduplication of origin will lead us to an indivisibility, a sigularity that resists further differentiation and has us all trapped in the glory and magic of being. hitherto called by various names in the reglious literature, this pure difference affords and opportunity to understand it by dissection of its extrusions - i.e. substance, matter etc. however any attempt to do so is a fool's errand - as if trying to understand the body by cutting up the shadow.


- thermodynamically, there is a line of causality to be established from the shadow such that the vector of time points towards the object casting the shadow. though this vector isn't traversable by being, it is nevertheless traversable by light. in certain mental afflictions such as narcissism, this vector is traversed by imaginary, symbolic, and a failure of the real. indeed most mental afflictions are spot failures or lapses in the real. think of narcissus, forever confused whether the reflection is causing him or vice versa.


- ordinarily though,  psychological fixtures and apparatuses forbid such an unfolding of causality and continuity of being beckons it onwards into dissolution, making entropy apparent but  the loss of being's corporeality is but an event in the memory of being - which can last for ages.
