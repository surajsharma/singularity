- it is causality which belies the expression of being as a finite, different subject of an infinite, indifferent object. 


- since perceived time is not causa-sui rather a consequence of pure difference (folding upon itself), the self-similarity between two succesive moments is a difference in itself. the superhighway of difference is punctuated with exits in time at self-similar and regular intervals 


- a determined being can thus, break the loop of eternal return to arrive at transcendental memory, which is memory in superposition, a door which opens into pure difference itself. though this journey is so fraught with existential, mythical, and symbolic dangers and fears that few attempt and fewer still arrive at the destination


- transcendental memory is a disembodied phenomenon it isn't a recall of time in the mind but a recall of time outside of any and all minds - in terms of its interface with pure difference, it is the rememberance of forgetting - the realm of all things lost, the kingdom of the imaginary


- Schr√∂dinger's cat is the keychain you misplaced last time until you found it, between the time you lost and found it, it was an artifact in transcendental memory - regardless of how many people saw it lying on the mantle, it was not there until you recalled its coordinates or somehow otherwise chanced upon it - including having someone else find it for you. 


- the way out of difference and into pure difference is a similar recall of something long forgetten, except the thing forgotten is forgetfulness itself


- blind spot of the  "big bang", or a singular entry point of time into substance is therefore a myth perpetuated by parochial and limited scientific foresight, there isn't a single original fold but as many as there are dimensions available for observation, which surely as mathematics confirms, are more than three.


- time is the perforation that marks the borders between one dimension and another, across which extends difference as planes of angularly folded faces of a singular, n-dimensional polyhedra. our observable universe is one such face.


-  the perforation itself is a duality consisting of succession of stiches and gaps between them, the stitch itself is an instance of difference and the cause of memory (difference welded to difference) whereas the gap is an instance of pure difference and the cause of transcendental memory (difference separated from itself)


- a lot could go differently between the disloging of the apple from the tree and it's impact with Newton's head, or between the time a bullet leaves the muzzle to meet its target ... the argument here isn't that causality branches out at each integral step of the way and we only experience but one of the multitudes, but rather that we are reminded of a singularity as opposed to recalling every permutation extant. 


- it is pertinent to discern between causality and continuation - what binds the diurnal nature of being's experience of time isn't a predetermined chain of cause-and-effect, but a determined political economy of continuity that intends to tell a singular story instead of a cacophony of bewildering qualia 


- continuity is linear time, while causality is quadratic hence can have more than a single solution or outcome of any possible eventuality. continuity unfolds at the intersection of time and memory whereas causality is a memory-dependent phenomenon. indeed, there are mental afflictions that result in a loss of faculties to establish causality but only death is the end of continuation.


- another somewhat crude analogy of this difference between causality and continuity could be in the "compression" of time, causality is lossy compression whereas continuity is lossless 


-  transcendental memory is a kind of a break in this encoding, an event within this political economy of time which swallows it as a whole, expressed either as a glut of memory or a bankruptcy of forgetting - causing, in either case,  a grounding of being into the time by way of returning to it every possible recallable event and, as a consequence, a grounding of being into eternal return. into that place referred to in revelation 10-6 where "there shall be time no longer".


- descriptions of such a skip in the recording and ordering of time are conscpicuous by their absence in the annals of human philosophy, including spiritual literature. therfore is ill-understood, and underreported as various states of "enlightenment" such as "nirvana" or "moksha", even though it is a well understood goal of the geist to achieve this state of affairs. 


- the reason why it remains an elusive ideal of spirit to achieve a metasensory understanding is exactly this determined binding of memory into difference. memory as a lossy encoding of difference prohibits any state of omniscience, causing reality to appear as a locally defined, limited expression of the limitless.

- cognitively speaking, the bend, crease, and fold dialectic is directly mapped to cognition, object, and subject. alternatively, it can be stated as the dialectic of observation, observer, and the observed subject.
