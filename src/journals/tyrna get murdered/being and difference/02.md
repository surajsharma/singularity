- it is causality which belies the expression of being as a finite, different subject of an infinite, indifferent object. 


- since perceived time is not causa-sui rather a consequence of pure difference (folding upon itself), the self-similarity between two succesive moments is a difference in itself. the superhighway of difference is punctuated with exits in time at self-similar and regular intervals 


- a determined being can thus, break the loop of eternal return to arrive at transcendental memory, which is memory in superposition, a door which opens into pure difference itself. though this journey is so fraught with existential, mythical, and symbolic dangers and fears that few attempt and fewer still arrive at the destination


- transcendental memory is a disembodied phenomenon it isn't a recall of time in the mind but a recall of time outside of any and all minds - in terms of its interface with pure difference, it is the rememberance of forgetting - the realm of all things lost, the kingdom of the imaginary


- Schr√∂dinger's cat is the keychain you misplaced last time until you found it, between the time you lost and found it, it was an artifact in transcendental memory - regardless of how many people saw it lying on the mantle, it was not there until you recalled its coordinates or somehow otherwise chanced upon it - including having someone else find it for you. 


- the way out of difference and into pure difference is a similar recall of something long forgetten, except the thing forgotten is forgetfulness itself


- blind spot of the  "big bang", or a singular entry point of time into substance is therefore a myth perpetuated by parochial and limited scientific foresight, there isn't a single original fold but as many as there are dimensions available for observation, which surely as mathematics confirms, are more than three.


- time is the perforation that marks the borders between one dimension and another, across which extends difference as planes of angularly folded faces of a singular, n-dimensional polyhedra. our observable universe is one such face.


-  the perforation itself is a duality consisting of succession of stiches and gaps between them, the stitch itself is an instance of difference and the cause of memory (difference welded to difference) whereas the gap is an instance of pure difference and the cause of transcendental memory (difference separated from itself)


- a lot could go differently between the disloging of the apple from the tree and it's impact with Newton's head, or between the time a bullet leaves the muzzle to meet its target ... the argument here isn't that causality branches out at each integral step of the way and we only experience but one of the multitudes, but rather that we are reminded of a singularity as opposed to recalling every permutation extant. 


- it is pertinent to discern between causality and continuation - what binds the diurnal nature of being's experience of time isn't a predetermined chain of cause-and-effect, but a determined political economy of continuity that intends to tell a singular story instead of a cacophony of bewildering qualia 


-  transcendental memory is a kind of a break in this political economy, expressed either as a glut of memory or a bankruptcy of forgetting - it is a grounding of being into the time by way of return of every possible recallable event and as a consequence, a grounding of being into eternal return
