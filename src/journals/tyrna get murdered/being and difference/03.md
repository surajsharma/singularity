- difference emergent from a self-alienated pure difference becomes a stable, self-sufficient configuration of negation and the infrastructure for eternal return.


- this configuration is completely virtual and hyperreal in the sense that what was real in pure difference is now extended and continues from it - a disembodied narcissus is born and gazes back from the reflection that defines it and into the entity that is reflected, all cognition is a reminiscence of this original gaze.


- the dense indeterminate singular subject optatively brings forth a sparse object, a shallow and determinate mutation thus creating a bi-directional system of causal inference in what is now a potent gradient of information 


- since there is nothing perceivable or perceptive about this system yet, any descriptive analysis of subject-object juxtaposition can only be binary-linguistic 


- although the system is primarily dual, difference between the two necessitates a boundary or border, or in terms of deconstruction, a "frame".


-  a near-symbolic object and a near-imaginary subject cannot transact (virtually or othwerwise) without the presence of a mediator of some sort, they are entities as disparate as a signal broadcasted for radio and a switched off receiver. 


-  a kind of lemmata thus is apparent, whether seen as Derrida's complicated notion of frame, or more simply, any one of the members of Buber's trinity of I-It-Thou. An agency at the border that turns on the radio and tunes it into a frequency.


-  in the time it has taken for the simple d/pd duality to fract-ure into a d,/,pd trinity all of time has come to pass.
