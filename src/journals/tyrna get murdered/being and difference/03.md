- difference emergent from a self-alienated pure difference becomes a stable, self-sufficient configuration of negation and the infrastructure for eternal return.


- this configuration is completely virtual and hyperreal in the sense that what was real in pure difference is now extended and continues from it - a disembodied narcissus is born and gazes back from the reflection that defines it and into the entity that is reflected, all cognition is a reminiscence of this original gaze.


- the dense indeterminate singular subject optatively brings forth a sparse object, a shallow and determinate mutation thus creating a bi-directional system of causal inference in what is now a potent gradient of information 


- since there is nothing perceivable or perceptive about this system yet, any descriptive analysis of subject-object juxtaposition can only be binary-linguistic 


- although the system is primarily dual, difference between the two necessitates a boundary or border, or in terms of deconstruction, a "frame".


-  a near-symbolic object and a near-imaginary subject cannot transact (virtually or othwerwise) without the presence of a mediator of some sort, they are entities as disparate as a signal broadcasted for radio and a switched off receiver. 


-  a kind of lemmata thus is apparent, whether seen as Derrida's complicated notion of frame, or more simply, any one of the members of Buber's trinity of I-It-Thou. An agency at the border that turns on the radio and tunes it into a frequency.


-  in the time it has taken for the simple d/pd duality to fract-ure into a d,/,pd trinity all of time has come to pass.  


-  this mediating agency '/' is the positive synthesis between two systemic negations, an interface shared over two parts of a single duality, similar to a day between two nights or an afternoon between two twilights.


- it is a plane of similarity existence stretching across two faces of difference, allowing one to be interpreted as a recall of the other - linguistically the connecting thread between signifier and signified. more concretely, image itself.


- in everyday life, we see the interface at work when we recognize a spelling mistake or identify the original brand from a cheap knockoff. even more obviously, when we identify heads from tails on a coin or differentiate between the obverse and reverse sides of a physical photograph. to be even more incredulous, image is what allows difference to be recognized. without the image no systems of difference may be related, no network of meaning may emerge.


- certainly, image here does not refer to the phenomenology of vision alone. but 'image' is just an apt signifier for the interface because vision is common and easier to understand than other sense data. indeed, for a sentience that did not have eyesight but only aural senses, a bone would be a sound alone and for two-dimensional 'flatlanders', the image would be a two-dimensional record.


- thus, facilitating the relationship between narcissus and his reflection is the surface of the water that affords an infinite recall. 


- an interface is a potential image, whereas an image is the representation of actuated potential. without narcissus' reflection, the surface of water is a negative not too dissimilar from the negative used in photographic film. similarly,  narcissus' face is a negative without recall of its features and the recall itself, the impression or memory of the reflection - which now is so active - is also a negative until the water activates it. through the mediation of the interface the dialectical completes its work. 



- two things of relative importance arise from this understanding - one, the formal difference between potential and active memory and two the dialectical structure of difference itself which is seemingly a difference ensnaring a duality from both constituent sides, without which, one is dealing exclusively in scalar differences.

- substance and time are the grammar of difference contextualised by inherent structure, whereas pure difference is a context-free grammar or pure structure of an absence. 


- this flat universe is a part of this mediating, contextualising agency enabling difference to peer into pure difference and vice-versa. it is, at the same time, both the recall of one of the faces of pure difference and an interface inviting that precise face to look and be recalled into existence.


- it is now possible to question the singularity of causal events such as the "big bang", for to give time a singular point of origin implies a corporeality of d/pd except the corporeality of a grammar is extant only in the structures of its expression. 


- expression, in so far as it implies or necessitates a medium cannot be decoupled from the difference that grounds it into its medium without fundamentally altering or disfiguring its import. the word cannot be separated from the spelling, the image from the representation, the colour from the qualia, the digital image from its binary sequence and so on.


- creation thus seems to be in the act of externalising of situated memory, in the projection of "remembrance of things past" onto an opaque field of pure determination giving rise to "time out of mind". 


- Historically, this field of pure determination  appears to be undergoing a diffusion or decentralisation with the proliferation of new mediums, thus, in a Platonic universe, it is only the wall in the cave from the famous allegory, today it is anything from newspapers, radio, or the superlative medium of the digital screen [6]


- the political economy of the observable universe is thus likened to a medium between two negatives of an insatiable consumer and an insatiable producer. with the content of the medium likened to an image of a producer producing and a consumer consuming.
