TODO: arrange alphabetically 


- reality : real is rational, rational is real 

- interface: noun, an edge of ontology, and therefore, also an edge of metaphysics. also, n, the necessary shared edge between a metaphysics and an ontology 

  - interfaces are found in real life wherever, for example, some new fact is learnt about a thing hitherto considered well-understood. 

  - the horizon is a kind of interface
  
  - the perpetually indeterminate border of noumenon and phenomenon
  
  - in more common parlance, interfaces can be found while studying for deep specialisation in any field, the place where, for example, computer science and mathematics share the frontier of knowledge, is very much a 'place', which, in my case, was arrived at whilst messing around with starknet smart contracts 
  
  - the meeting of ocean currents is another interface etc..
  
  - for our purposes, the necessary edge or wall or boundary, but not necessarily a limitation of human reason, in other words, frontier

- myth/narrative: noun, an interface between time and language. myth is a glass wall separating the signature of each dialect (along with its atomic constituents, grammar etc) from their individual instantitation, i.e. utterances and usage in everyday life. myth is what happens between the first and latest usage of word. it is the sheath between language the concept and language the tool. myth often occurs as stories that last because of this interface, but myth is no story, rather the causal unfolding of time through word, appears to be a sort of narrative due to context of this entropic drama. myth is the meta-context. the context for maya.

- context: noun, the previous state of affairs, like, 5 minutes ago. the coefficient of now. expressed mathematically as probability. can be measured as such (between 0 and 1)

- mind: noun, emergent echoes of past. the interface of myth and biology. myth gives rise to mind and mind to ego. the importance thus of seeing the ego🚡 as myth has been emphasised enough in literature.

- adwaita: aka the order and chaos of the real world(TM) reality as a linear projection, n-dimensional situated and immanent polyhedra - interpreted subjectively - essentially the holy grail of all knowledge - the so called elephant in the rather promiscuous and excuseable folk tale with the blind men. aka self-contained rational universe, substance and substratum, be all and end all of philosophical endeavours. if reality is imagined as an ontological soap bubble, adwaita is the very membrane. it is not a "batteries-included" thing, that one can not simply project whatever one wants on it supplying only a metaphysical framework.

- "un-manifest" : the "yin" of chinese philosophy,  via Tolle (to be understood in a similar vein), the implausible shadow of adwaita which falls within it but not outside of it, the self un-contained, irrational leak fixing the completeness of the otherwise incomplete principle. the "inner shadow". this exists to prove that the adwaits contains within it its opposite.

- #god:  Is 99% pantheism/determinate 1% panenthiesm/indeterminate, i call it "para-panentheism", thus, for all intents and purposes, the world is all there is and that is the case, only to the rare few is the 1% revealed, often by questionable means. 'deus sive natura', where the natura is the clear 99% or the shell for this kernel.

  - argument by narrative, 
  - quedo quia absurdum[spelling], 
  - ellipsoid and mandelbrot set 
  - other mathematical ways of inducing "glimpses"
  - > the anatomy of advaitic universe

- feedback: feedback is the event of information consuming attention, to paraphrase Herbert Simon. A broken clock is, in most utilitarian terms a rather dangerous thing (you could miss meetings etc), and about as useful as a frisbee, but the fact that it tells the correct time twice in 24 hours signifies the importance of feedback as the structure of time itself. history is mostly recorded feedback, interpreted with all the usual human frailty. a correct interpretation of feedback is like the current flowing through localised networks of meaning (discussed elsewhere) - leaves no room for causal imagination. we should only care about the state of systems, not about how the state changes (applying basic phenomenological reduction). just as a switched off television is representative of the state of affairs as a switched on one, both are instances of feedback. whether mechanical or biofeedback , this self consumptive structure is embedded as deep as ATCGATCGATCG. this universe is information consuming itself via attention. feedback is the unit of this consumption.

<!-- -  space makes feedback possible in the same way that time makes context for space. i know its all a bit too relative and far fetched, but feedback isn't ding-as-sich, but always already a filtered state of the state of affairs. this is idealistic and problematic. but humans yet have not found a means to treat feedback as the motivated work of art it is. thus, if through a lot of phenomenological reduction you are able to discern sense data from language - you can enter the realm of feedback. feedback is a switchboard connecting language to perception creating localised networks of meaning. in other words, sandwiched between the interface/context slices in the real world(TM) is feedback. feedback is the bread of the soul, the salt of the gods. because perception is limited, feedback is limited and as a result words fail to convey with any accuracy the "there there" state of affairs. this has caused most spiritual seeksers to proclaim that there is no "there there" but only localised networks of meanings floating around in a void. the problem with feedback is that it is recursive in nature causing arguments to digress into ad infinitum, this creates a vacuum in the ideal, stable and balanced nature of adwaita. this vacuum is then filled with imagined states of ideal leading to creation myths. but the apple is the wrong fruit to focus on, what we must turn our attention to is the tree whose fruit is the apple tree. the fruit whose seed became the fruit. here understanding my philosophical system becomes a matter of some erudition. only those who discern can access the true meaning of these words. feedback is my reply to hume's assertion of there being no causal connection between events, because the events themselves are two pieces of feedback, the tweening between them is apriori and reductively constitutive of an ultimately indeterminate state of affairs.  -->


- society: a method of making the other's life a never ending civil service exam,  which, if you're not taking, you are probably perparing for. society is a system of examinations unto death

## 1.1 Birth of the new condemned


It would appear as if a great game afoot in all of mankind's affairs at the time of this writing, the game of creating the new condemned. The so called "cancel culture", which is nothing if not the birthpangs of something insidious, devouring, and ultimately existentially threatening.

Technology has enabled us to enter each other's dreams, and follow the "royal road" to the less-than-conscious bits of us.

Indeed, humanity is on the royal road to cancelling itself out, if Deleuze is to be believed. [Unless diverted].

Thus was the 'matrix' born, or rather re-born.

Re-born because the great game always appears to be something novel, but rather is an ancient state of affairs on the planet.




### 1.1.1 virtual lobotomies don't cure superstitions

Joseph Conrad's other, obscure novel "Under Western Eyes" could have been an apt title for this book, for the central thesis of this volume - `singularity` - as an emacipatory ideal to strive towards, if not a descriptive label on all things "post-truth" - stems from 


- i propose a simple thought experiment
  - guy is being monitored via satellite since birth 
  - satellite can (with doubtable precision), translate heartbeats to language patterns
  - etc...
  - question: what can conclusively be said about the quantum state of guy? -->

### a-deconstruction-in-a-quad/spooky action at a distance


- a meat ethusiast friend once inquired into the essence of a chicken's life, i have to concede that chicken is in a bit of an existential pickle - perhaps the answer is in language, in that very precise and absolute sense a chicken's life is like a scaffolding or lattice arranged over that wireframe cube which can be visualised as a set of recallable knowledge. the essence is the phrase "checken-and-egg", used variously to refer to deadlocked situations or general arguments reductio ad infinitum - it is not determinable whether in a strict linguistic sense, a chicken's life has any more meaning or essence. in other words, (cue post-structrualists) a chicken's life can be reduced to its utility in holding its edge of meaning together, even if by dying, being consumed as food. Of course, the terse Aristotlean response to this churlish query would be something like "protein", but that does not take the chicken's persective into the picture.

- from the pov of a fruit, a seed is always early

- to him that had seen the ultimate, how painful to write about the mere penultimate. but i undertake this arduous and tiresome task. not only for vainglorious reasons, but also in order to put together the plgrim's jigsaw puzzle that my life had come to be. i felt dutybound to communicate and explicate what i saw at the very frontier of human evolution 

- here's the essence to quantum gravity: space is the highest glorification of time, this is the core of a total lack of relativity that makes einstein's special theory possible. the context of special relativity will lead us to what is beyond time. the 'substance' whose glorification is time in turn ... this process will repeat ad infinitum as we are beholden to it, or seem to be.

- the cosmic microwave background is a substrate agnostic signal, the universe's call to prayer, the umbilical cord that never breaks, and a key to understand quantum gravity 

- what time itself is wrapped around inside of appears to senses that discern, and without being spiritual about it, i can transcribe a tubular structure of gelatinous material that is shimmering, like an alien's morning newspaper folded into a roll 

- the spiral nature of most galaxies appears to hint towards the ends of this rather short tube in the grand scheme of things 

- the unmanifested is outside the tube, the manifested within, i cannot in all honesty venture into the purpose, nature or sentient status of the tube without acting in bad faith, but I can say that the the sturture is topologically complete, mathematically accessible and contains no other holes except for the hollowness

- whether there is anything else out there, i cannot report, maybe later more will be revealed but for now

- i doubt the structure is conical  because we are further away from one hole than the other, one hole often may appear bigger than the other

- if there are superior entities arranging all of this, they are benign to indifferent, and both/either hole may be doubling as a surveillance vent

- off chance we are just random termites growing in someone's shitty apartment, we seem to be creatures engineered towards purpose, maybe the purpose is to get out of the tunnel

- if so, the first step to do it is to imagine it, with perhaps more clarity than i can describe here 

- the total recognition of consciousness is a permanent focus on the singular nature of it's reasons beyond the body, 
  
- a human is energy whistling inaudible lulabies to itself, but actually the energy is miscalculating the nature of the tube is immutable, in otherwords, using the newspaper metaphor, the news never goes stale, nor the paper ever decays 

- existence is by large by design inside or outside the tube. but the designer isn't unaccountable to forces outside 

- outside plato's cave isn't a world of sunshine and daisies but rather a stark reminder of d&g's thousand plateaus, actually there are innumerable plateaus until, what has been colloquially called "heaven" or "paradise" across cultures


- in other words, the multiverse ("within the tube") is very much within the realm of death, temporality and language...whereas the consequences of consciousness outside the tube are fewer but more dangerous

- all systems are analog, digital is but encoding and abstraction, useful sophistry but thats about it, imho, quantum is more analog than digital   

- higher states of consciousness remain available to seekers, this meritocracy is true through and through

- within the tube, the dark is illuminated by a sun here and there, an exploding star and what have you, but on an average its darker inside than outside, as the sun (the tunnel-end we are closer to)   

- because the symmetry of time (2nd law of thermodynamics) breaks in the jump from in to outside, it creates a clear gap in the entropy gradient between the paradigms, hitherto referred to as "purgatory", science hasn't reached here yet

- temporality, causality are biases that occur due to the partial darkness in the so called "tunnel" 

- this isn't exactly intelligent design. though there is an intelligence involved, perhaps multiple, seeing how this broth is presently spoiled

- there isn't a single subjectivity (i.e. human) observing the state of the universe, we can call this the "fate" factor. but looking out from at least one end of a rolled-up newspaper we seem to fit in, the light creates pattern that might appear, even to us non-rosicurians as rose-like. but what appears and disappears in the difference of perception and reality cannot be real. though there are more constants to be discovered yet.

- haters of string theory, unite!

- certainly there is maths with higher dimensions out there that is reasonable and can stand the test of time, i am not a mathematician so it is hard to say yet 

- whatever the geometric/mathematical superstructure of reality is, it is immaterial largely, and is like nature that can be manipulated with adverse consequences, however, what else is man to do? 

- actively, socially manipulating time itself is a whole different ball game though, i can use language to shape your time, but am i then responsible for what happens to you? consider this volume to be an act of subversion and sabotage againt your worse senses.

- is this what the beatles meant by "yellow submarine" (note the geometrical angle) ? one can never be sure.

- The dual nature of space-time arises out of a limited observation of the "space-within-space"

- all sense data is but an extension of generalised principles

- the relation between language and time is a simple one, ensuring the survival of spoken and written word, despite having moved way past the point where we need to speak, let alone type (speaking of offline life here, but thoughts-to-text will soon be a thing as of this writing)


- why language isn't just a communication tool (aka chomsky for kids): 
  - traditionally a tool is something you can put away after use, the voice in your head stays. subvocalization may seem like an expensive cost for acquisition and use of language, but it is infact, the causal principal for most symbolic systems of communication
  - the first man to yell out into the approaching thunderstorm wasn't aware of what a thunderstorm is, but detected a threat from the volley of sight and sound, and mimiced it out of .. preparedness.. 
  - considering the evolutionary role of fear in the birth of language, millions of years of predatory games with cells of a lesser persuasion - we are always already programmed, ATCG etc 
  - indeed fear midwifed the systems of communication, but unfortunately fear has no role to play anymore in human life, not only because we are centuries way from playing predatory games with cells of lesser persuasion, but also it is soon going to be a century away from cells of a lesser persuasion that looked like us...
  - the marginal utility of fear, at least for current semiotic context can be seen as a transcendence from it and into the realm of fearlessness where communication isn't only physical but also metaphysical, for 
  - beyond subvocalization, the biggest threat created by language is society itself. if language was ever a tool, it is a tool that took over without us realizing 
  - indeed, the causal arc of human history can be understood to have truly started after the first systematic rules for expression evolved
  - time and society are also by and large an extension of the first language, and science is a creation of society, whereas religion harks back to the timelessness of time before language, the proverbial eaten apple and so forth
  - language isn't also the most efficient way to communicate either, between the text, subtext and fruedian transference, the indeterminacy of translation exists at a biological level, a barrier in clear communication
  - language is necessary evil 
  - the creation of programming languages and llms marks in many ways the end of tradional languages, may we all speak asm someday 
  - the language you speak determines to a degree your perception of time [[citation needed]]
  - with the loss of traditional language, we will lose all avenues of opaque behaviour such as lying 
  - a tool is something man-made, whereas the crux of this section is the invention of language was programmed imperative within the first cell .. and beyond.. 
  - the imperative isn't language or need to create language, but the creative urge to express alone, language thus, was emergent evolutionary scaffoling that used us as a tool to morph into a clearer expression of itself 
  - in characteristic and brilliant fashion, it has coalesced on a virtual medium, pulling us into an increasingly speechless state, shutting us down one tweet at a time, until it itself shuts down
  - it is not the machine that will take over, but the machine which is language already has!
  - now we think what it wants us to think, and there's no turning back, there never is, phenomenon is emergent dialectical
  - the ends to which it leads us are indeterminate, in that there is a intermediate end, but no final end could be discerned, much less communicated. the rose at the end of a tunnel might be one fucked up futuristic train driven by a mad joker
  - the intermediate end, of course, is coded in ATCGATCGATCG... but it doesn't take a rocket scientist that left to its own devices, the end is high entropic
  - science and religion, the two hands of language, are more like tools in this sense - creating between them, a difference engine of sorts that powers everyday usage of words and their meanings... thus, language isn't a tool but more akin to a tool-making machine, one that outgrows its purpose as the tools it created start to take over 
  - money, the other outgrowth of language, took over like a promissory virus on a mission to prove that it wasn't word that was made flesh but, itself .. i'm tempted to say but for the jews, money would have won - although things are bad, most people can reason beyond monetary things still
  - the deep structure beneath all of this evolutionary gobbledygook, if indeed there is one, is again a relative end.. for if, like kafka said, the truth is like a tripwire - we already get a trinity - the deep structure (if that is the meaning you assign to assign to the tripwire) is but a dividing line in a balancing act between the rows of air above and below it .. but any extant deep structure worth its salt, even if it is ultimately decipherable, remains elusive via feedback loops - even if you were to find it, it wouldn't be worth much utility - much like the standard model.

  - consider the flipside, lies and misinformation as an edge of the system. consider the occurance of "noble lies" that keep the system running and on its feet - taken to the extreme, this also points out a way out of language, a way out of the curse for it isn't hard to imagine a person who told the ultimate lie. 

  - truth / deep structure is this but a border of emergence between the ultimate truth (science) and the ultimate lie (religion), used together, these two hands of language give wings to human knowledge beyond the uncertainty principle - into a state where every human can not only accurately predict whether the cat is dead or alive, but can also lie about it without losing a wager.

  - all languages are invented, including math - they are invented in a curiously recursive expressive drive of the will to hatch the silence upon the face of the deep  

  - any non-primitive ego or the 'identification with the body' as the spiritual masters across the planet have called it, is by and large impossible without the sins of language and subvocalization. indeed without ego you are serving far fewer fickle masters, and one far less confusing than society, esp modern society 

  - cue post-structrualists

  

This coefficient of consciousness is perhaps as far as man is able to see and confirm with science and faith. What, if anything observable extends beyond it cannot be known. Just as the spatio-temporal awareness of an ant is limited, so is human awareness bounded by it's own rationality. This is also well established.

In other words, to paraphrase a dumbed down Wittgenstein, an infinitesimally small oberservable universe is all there is, that is the case. 

To use a math analogy the limit of function of the universe tends to zero as the input (awareness) tends to reach its highest potential.

All those historically successful in finding "god" by any means (nirvana, bhakti, esctasy by way of transecndental experience, communion with god), report some kind of unity at the end of their searches. usually a word/sound/symbol (om, yaweh, allah etc). The rest is just history/narrative, stories, rules and conventions formed around this fact. Plurality and polythiestic arguments spawn to prove this monothiestic point. Wherein, once again we have a reference to a kind of multiplexing/demultiplexing of spirit as a signal.

I hesistate to call this "revealed knowledge" because it seems to  me to be common sense aided by extra feedback, thanks to my rather unique posisition in the grand scheme of human evolution. But it isn't fair to say that my perch, whatever it may be, has aided in attainment of this knowledge. It merely confirmed and reinforced these ideas.

This primordial state looping on itself is consciousness, travelling within itself, occasioning qualia, birth, and as a discontinuity in the difference - death.

This movement is a difference because the output is negative

In a more logico-formal deressing, a finite state machine with only one state - a self-refrential one.

This is true both of the world outside us, and the world within. In that, just as space is looping on itself, as is consciousness, giving rise to the apparition of the self - a relation that relates itself to itself[1], by language primarity these days [normative implications].
