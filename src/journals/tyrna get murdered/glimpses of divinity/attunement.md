## attunement / disclaimer: committing it to flames

وَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ حَيْثُ ثَقِفْتُمُوهُمْ وَأَخْرِجُوهُم مِّنْ حَيْثُ أَخْرَجُوكُمْ ۚ وَٱلْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ ٱلْقَتْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُقَـٰتِلُوهُمْ عِندَ ٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ حَتَّىٰ يُقَـٰتِلُوكُمْ فِيهِ ۖ فَإِن قَـٰتَلُوكُمْ فَٱقْتُلُوهُمْ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ جَزَآءُ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ ١٩١

Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them—that is the reward of the disbelievers.
- Quran 2:191


यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत।
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ॥ ४-७॥
परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् ।
धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ॥४-८॥    

Whenever There Is A Decline In Righteousness And An Increase In Sinfulness, O Arjun, At That Time I Manifest Myself On Earth. To Protect The Righteous, To Annihilate The Wicked, And To Reestablish The Principles Of Dharma I Appear On This Earth, Age After Age.
- SBD 4:8:7


“Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.”

― Friedrich Nietzsche

----

i was born into a persecution unto death. on that unfortunate crossroads where little rock arkansas intersects with wall street. Though i was not special in any way, through the racist, jealous inequity of a secret covenant amongst the mob that surrounded me and danced around me since even before birth, I became charged enough with some spiritual authority, enabling and ennobling me enough to write this tome.

exactly how i was ridiculed, slow poisoned, rendered a freak and pervert, while being made a global spectacle throughout my life is the beautiful and tragic part of my life's story. since i was kept mostly in the dark about most of it until quite late in the day, this part is better told by others. 

what i seek to elucidate here are the boring bits, the uncommon nearness to the divine principle afforded to me by virtue of my sufferings. 

this work of comparative philosophy and religion shall unfold by means of abstract and experimental reasoning, jumps to unfalsifiable hypothesis, references to historical myths and invocation of concepts that are still too young for most of humanity to grasp, let alone accept. 

anyone looking for exacting analytical standards and scientific "proof" would promptly find themselves irritated beyond measure within the first few pages. this volume is a work of exacting faith and it is the author's contention that only the faithless demand proof.

this volume was also written under quite extraordinary circumstances during which my faith was tested in every measurable way imaginable, as such, these words poured out of the pain and sheer ecstasy of consciousness gone gonzo and visions delivered by the ensuing circumstance.

anyone expecting formal logic, evidence of divinity, normative expatiations about the miracle that is being etc. should, in the words of Hume, "commit it to flames", for to them, it will come across as nothing but sophistry, casuistry, and illusion.

there is no purport of this book except what it can demonstrably support using common sense and some not so common knowledge. it does not put forth a new religion, nor does it aim to throw the apple cart off balance. 

loosely stated, the central aim of the book is to weave the theistic strand running alongside human thought into a stronger lattice-like framework upon which future endeavours can be planned and executed.

though there is a presriptive element, it is localised to individual thought and presented as an addendum to any generally educated, well informed world view. 

It is the author's hope that the reader will come away with a richer understanding of the world she inhabits after reading this volume.
