3. `brahmin inside the military-industrial complex` (MIC as a home of the rhizome/OwB(Žižek(2004)), birth of krishna, garden of eden as MIC,  use of tantra to achiveve brahminical freedoms, re-reading kafka as a magician, surveillance, privacy, entropy, "sea of glass", singularity, hyperreality as a frame for the desert, where (even contrarian) systems are useless (loops vs systems), on putting weapons-grade tech in civilian hands, brahminical narcisissm (its victims and discontents), life in liminal spaces and other uncanny valleys, huxley vs orwell, causality and brakes (hume), )

- the screen will become the new wall, it will wrap around your eyes until only it remains, then even in death you will be an extension of it, it will be hard to say where the vr headset ends and the coffin begins



- the military-industrial complex is about as evil as a fence, i'm sure they have other even more dangerous toys but in my story, these weren't the bad guys, as for surveillance my guess is the tech used on me shouldnt be too hard to come by for any reasonably well to do nation, it is the act of using it that raises the real questions - 1) do we realize how close to being gods we came? 2) can we handle at playing god? for what its worth, two new open ended questions.
