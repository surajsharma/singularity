The Product of Television. Commercial Television. Is the Audience.

Television delivers people to an advertiser.

There is no such thing as mass media in the United States except for television.

Mass media means that a medium can deliver masses of people.

Commercial television delivers 20 million people a minute.

In commercial broadcasting the viewer pays for the privilege of having himself sold.

It is the consumer who is consumed.

You are the product of t.v.

You are delivered to the advertiser who is the customer.

He consumes you.

The viewer is not responsible for programming------

You are the end product.

You are the end product delivered en masse to the advertiser.

You are the product of t.v.

Everything on television is educational in the sense that it teaches something.

What television teaches through commercialism is materialistic consumption.

The NEW MEDIA STATE is predicated on media control.

Media asserts an influence over an entire cultural spectrum without effort or qualification.

We are persuaded daily by a corporate oligarchy.

Corporate control advocates materialistic propaganda.

Television establishments are committed to economic survival:

Propaganda for Profit.

Television is the prime instrument for the management of consumer demands.

Commercial television defines the world in specific terms.

Commercial television defines the world so as not to threaten the status quo.

Television defines the world so as not to threaten you.

Soft propaganda is considered entertainment.

POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT IS BASICALLY PROPAGANDA FOR THE STATUS QUO.

POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT IS BASICALLY PROPAGANDA FOR THE STATUS QUO.

Control over broadcasting is an exercise in controlling society.

Seventy-five percent of news is received by you from television.

What goes on over the news is what you know.

It is the basis by which you make judgements, by which you think.

You are the controlled product of news programming.

Television programming dominates the exposure of ideas and information.

There is inherent conflict between:

COMMERCE,

INFORMATION,

ENTERTAINMENT.

There is a mass media compulsion to reinforce the status quo. To reinforce the distribution of power.

The NEW MEDIA STATE is dependent on television for its existence.

The NEW MEDIA STATE is dependent on propaganda for its existence.

Corporations that own networks control them.

CORPORATIONS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE.

CORPORATIONS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO GOVERNMENT.

CORPORATIONS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES.

CORPORATIONS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.

Shareholders do not organize and enforce their will. Shareholders will buy stock in companies and don't even know what the companies do.

Corporations mitigate information.

Every dollar spent by the television industry in physical equipment needed to send a message to you is matched by forty dollars spent by you to receive it.

You pay the money to allow someone else to make the choice.

You are consumed.

You are the product of television.

Television delivers people.
