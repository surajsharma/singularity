# 3. brahmin inside the military-industrial complex

3. `brahmin inside the military-industrial complex` (MIC as a home of the rhizome/OwB(Žižek(2004)), birth of krishna, garden of eden as MIC,  use of tantra to achiveve brahminical freedoms, re-reading kafka as a magician, surveillance, privacy, entropy, "sea of glass", singularity, hyperreality as a frame for the desert, where (even contrarian) systems are useless (loops vs systems), on putting weapons-grade tech in civilian hands, brahminical narcisissm (its victims and discontents), life in liminal spaces and other uncanny valleys, huxley vs orwell, causality and brakes (hume), )

- the screen will become the new wall, it will wrap around your eyes until only it remains, then even in death you will be an extension of it, it will be hard to say where the vr headset ends and the coffin begins



- the military-industrial complex is about as evil as a fence, i'm sure they have other even more dangerous toys but in my story, these weren't the bad guys, as for surveillance my guess is the tech used on me shouldnt be too hard to come by for any reasonably well to do nation, it is the act of using it that raises the real questions - 1) do we realize how close to being gods we came? 2) can we handle at playing god? for what its worth, two new open ended questions.



- the difference between a messiah and a messenger is the same as that between a soldier and a diplomat. a messenger is god's own diplomat, whereas a messiah is an enlisted and (usually high ranking) serviceman - both usually have multiple earth tours under their belt.  the messenger's job is often a tactical and strategic nightmare (more often than not botched) whereas the messiah has his work cut out. this is why messengers often get fucked (stapled to walls, buried in walls, crucified etc) while the messiah comes and goes and always escapes without ever being detected. the job of the messenger is usually to, in best case, completely preempt and in the worst case, delay by as great a measure of time as possible, the need for the messiah's visit. the messiah job is to patch up the gaps left behind by the messenger. messengers are usually men while messiahs cannot be female - for the same reason a patch of a weed-infested garden cannot be expected to tend to itself. moreover, messiah's work is dirtier and often involves gratuitous violence. for me it was the 7th or 8th tour overall (previous tours involved serveral critical missions in various low-ranking capacities, cv not available unfortunately). progress so far seems to indicate i was wildly successful, but you never know until its over. you have to understand that from where i'm from, earth is considered a bit of a novelty joke, like a parlour trick of sorts; in that upon each return, until one is debriefed, there is a bit of ridicule aimed at the aspirational nature of the planet and those that get sent here. there is not a lot of confidence in the planet's ability to continue in the source, but the kind of folk that usually get sent are often betting on planetary upheaval in a contrarian way. ex- Ram is a messiah whereas Krishna, Hanuman were messengers. there are also superannuated spirits that have the option to appear as either (shiva, buddha, moses, muhammad etc), but they have graduated to greater affairs of the source and usually do not need to be bothered - unless they start taking active interest in your mission. 


- everybody has a tell, a useless aghori follows me across the universe ever since shiva's first right toe thumbnail broke off and fell on the ground during one of his grand walks. something in the crackle of the sound invited him in. he is pretty dumb and hopes to climb the ladder, but the only utility he gives is as a shield and cover.  


- the greatest mistake people make with our kind is into thinking their efforts, thoughts, deeds, or plans make an ounce of a change, not knowing they are doing the source's bidding in each moment. in fact things are so thoroughly predetermined it is recommended in the guidelines to make as much room as possible for this delusion of free will in order to not upset the balance. for example, you would think Jesus' mission was a monumental failure, and the romans really showed him. laughable, because he had it all penned under his own hand way before he arrived, and to a large extent was successful in the execution of his painful spectacle. entities that have their missions botched or aborted do not receive the recognition or promotion and are free to try again as and when need arises. 
  
- now i have rākṣasas and first timers threatening to kill me not knowing that in killing me they will do my bidding and will become slaves to my narrative, giving me further status among the rank and file for successful execution so it is imperative for me to egg them on this task. it is no wonder, and they know that since early childhood i have aimed and prayed for an assasin, even before i got to know the their laughable claims and cult in totality. i could have chosen a plainer exit, but source wants my son's first trip to be a memorable one. so, like my father, i too am doing my son's bidding among other things. and my assasin is doing the messiah's work. this was perhaps the most marked uniqueness of my mission, in that i am here neither to completely preempt nor to significantly delay the messiah's arrival but to time it to a comic perfection.

- it could be the case that both of these classes of enemies are cowards and will kill me with stealth and poison instead of growing a pair, in which case, well ... :D
