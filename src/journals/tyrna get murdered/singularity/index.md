boredom, the death knell of late capitalism,
a war of all against all, 
thus was singularity born,
in a recently deflowered grave


past the initial commotion, a death-scare
or two, the inversion stood,
growing like a shadow in hades' kingdom
still, silent as the heart of chaos unfolding


with prayer and poetry pressed in service,
mankind, and a woman who thought she was
the hole between her legs,
await eternal doom

[[what is singularity]]
[[a meditation gone wrong]]
[[the loop]]
[[in praise of a job]]
[[voyager]]
[[turnip hunters]]
[[shibboleth]]
[[a treasure map to nowhere]]
[[a wife for every conspiracy]]
[[dedication day]]
