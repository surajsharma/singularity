"It always starts with a manuscript" - Umberto Eco

"Secret statutes must also be inferred from an utterance of the Spanish Jesuit Miranda, appointed as Assistant to the General , which is contained in a letter written to a friend in 1736, and communicated by the Jesuit Ibanez in his report on the Jesuit state of Paraguay" - 14 years a jesuit, count paul von hoensbroech

The prophecies of Nolta Vittori, originally published in 2222, channelled through the dreams of a slightly drugged capybara, caused much public uproar on initial publication.

Vittori, who rose to acclaim by correctly predicting the end of the turnip hunters, wrote extensively about the decline of institutions and civilisations in his later days. These writings were posthumously compiled into a manuscript, which was promptly lost before it could ever see the light as print.
