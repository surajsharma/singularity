# dedication day

 the earth left it's orbit in the 25th century.


It became a crystalline structure, a glow-in-the-dark low poly vertical ellipsoid made for Interstellar voyages.


A new holiday was going to mark the departure from the solar system of course, we called it "Dedication Day".


"Three centuries of collective endeavour has born the fruits of recorded history, and today, being the first day of February in the year of our lord 2444, "the crucifix", as it is affectionately called, sets it's metaphorical sails  towards the unknown, the uncharted universe." , wrote senator Sigmund P. Musk (who originally came up with the idea of the holiday) in his log on the last morning of Common Era and the first one of a new common era for which a suitable name was being debated amongst historians.


Other world leaders chimed in similar well rehearsed refrains about progress.

The idea was to find an exit from the observable universe, perhaps see other dimensions of gravity, find quantum superpowers to colonize further while avoiding certain probably toxic parts of this perilous universe. The idea also had a shadowy interpretation in circles like the heliophobes that had come to see the sun as a dying symbol of god's repression, tying up the feminine spirit of the planet in what they deemed "surveillance orbit".



Others even sought to see God out there, so naturally the jubilation in the streets wasn't going to stop for a while. 



Me and my family decided to move to Kinshasa while the jingos jingled but even there, hooliganism abounded and we found little peace. It wasn't just the loud motorcycles and kazoos and vuvuzelas nor the "no more sunshine" t-shirts, nor how everyone sounded louder and colorful than usual, but it was how even silence seemed to shine with complaints from the cosmic background radiation.



"This is going to pinch a little," said Nadine, the nurse on duty that day, i was getting my last hepatitis shot.
