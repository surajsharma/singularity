# a treasure map to nowhere


- the tantrik was invited to become a liason to the alien civilisation that created the observable universe as an experiment. the earth is their prison planet, lesser entities and criminals are put here as humans and other lifeforms. the sun is the superintendant a massive survillance program, the moon a deputy, a good cop to allow for some lighter moments.  the civilisation has an internal resistance structure that has vowed to free these "innocents". from time to time there are extinction events, natural calamities, diseases, wars and other strife, that's the resistance at work. something the tantrik had to manoeuvre around. the objective of the tantrik's mission is twofold, firstly to figure out if the experiment has run its course, and secondly, if it has run its course, to start the chain of events that leads to an implosion of the sun. for the first part of the mission the tantrik was given 38 human years, knowing full well what he was venturing into, he completed the first objective by his 34th year. his report essentially stated that the experiment hadn't outlived its utility, which made a faction of his superiors doubt it, thinking he was just being lazy. this led to new debate in the echelons of power while the tantrik, who couldn't believe his own findings for he too wanted a hero's exit had a bigger problem - what to do with the rest of his life, bored out of his mind, he decided to become a renegade and follow through on the rest of the mission anyway

REPORT ON THE FIRST OBJECTIVE

=========


Executive Summary:  The intelligence muddles through, still evolves incrementally, still enamoured with sense data. Rarely does an individual see both the trees and the forest. Previous ranking liasons have bungled up the mission in different ways, Jesus upset the wrong crowd, Buddha retreated, Abraham nearly killed his own son, Shiva barely escaped by driking poison and Krishna ended up justifying war. The incumbent got a close shave and a new haircut on wall street, only to submit to a begrudging optimism owed to the intelligence's newfangled ability to morph into a network. Reccomend extension until the next resistance event.

Introduction

Within four years I went from being dog food to a saint, but the real progress was from being a single-celled organism hanging out with millions of other shitfaced geezers in test tube in a Hermes bag to a humble dog. What appeared to be dog or saint was in reality, light from a star so far away from the realm of their vision that by the time they saw the light the star had shifted.

- we caught a completely transparent lobster, it seemed to glow with all kinds of colourful lights on the inside so naturally we decided to teach it JavaScript.
