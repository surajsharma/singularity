# a wife for every conspiracy

after the outing we drew up the terms of the covenant.

having burnt the last printed copy of the old source by the banks of px-9, we had ascended back up to mashobra, the last village before meru peak. it was quite funny how the mazaks named a village only after it had acquired, or was provided a functional role in the economy. to the mazaks, everything outside their economic bubble was unnamed, and the local names were never to be recognized. lucky for us, this meant less legal troubles if we ever got caught. a nameless village in a tiny corner of vini-minor was not only hard to find, it was equally hard to give a fuck about for any galactic power.


although nothing about the terrestrial planet maza was out of curriculum, perhaps its eerie, perpetual twilight could drive some crazy after having spent a month or so there. or so i thought.


writing the manifest and shell of the new covenant was easy enough, for we had decided on the rules and procedures, preferring to keep things as simple for poor earthlings as possible. the hard part of the bargain was feeding the printout to a Montenegrin llama. we deliberated over the execution while sipping soma at the only soma bar in the village 


"its quite simple, if you don't want my dream on your horizon, we swap horizons until the dreams match"

"so this is where civilisations come to die"


"indeed, and did you hear about the earthlings?"

"yeah, well, they just left orbit"

"armed?"


"nothing too fancy"

"should be simple then, right, i mean its a matter of a simple request then"

"there is one teeny weeny problem with that"


"fuck"

"as long as the tantrik lives they will sniff it out"


"well"
