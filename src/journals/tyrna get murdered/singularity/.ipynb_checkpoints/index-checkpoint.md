# Chapter 1

[[context: Sonu grew up on a petrol pump in Chandigarh, so perhaps it was  in due to the fumes that he started having all these dreams that I have tried to compile here. People still reminisce about the various tortures he endured at the hands of the five families that owned the station, but they also miss their heyday and how they once lorded over greener pastuers.]]

ost: twilight and ghost stories
scene: a solitary sonu trying to relax in the pump's office gets beaten for sitting in the wrong chair, before getting abducted by a white couple

One autumn afternoon upon returning from school, Sonu put his feet up on the boss' table, arched over backwards in the massive black leather chair in front of the wall which had somehow managed to hide behind a poster that said "the first million is the hardest to make", wondering in his characteristic casual daze precisely how hard it could be, he looked out the glass wall to his right, shielding him from the setting sun alone.

Living through memories of other slow evenings, like yesterday's, when he, vulnerable and proud and full of the vital ignorance of youth, jerked off to a memory of only hours earlier having seen, for the first time in his life, a woman drive a car, a chevy at that. 

"I fucked a llama to get out of a cult, then I fucked a female leprechaun and stole all her gold", said the middle aged thickset and bald man riding with her as she pulled up into the filling bay

"your dreams make no sense darling", she said  bringing the [color] to a beautifully rehearsed halt,

Yesterday we departed at twilight, not civil or astronomical, but nautical twilight. The journey ahead meticulously planned and thought out over centuries, a labyrinth numbed by the gods themselves. Through an atmospheric tunnel in time, a way meant only for kings, generals and holy men to escape was our way in. Our mission clear as daylight, to hatch a new liberation for the world and rid it of the yoke of inequity.

This great and promised adventure was to lead us to our own personal liberation too, but that was besides the bigger aim of our movement. Of course, each of us had an individual agenda as well, but that was an even smaller fry in the grand scheme of things. I for one, was trying to retrieve five pieces of poetry lost, that I had penned down in an earlier lifetime.


Our mission was wrapped up in a conspiracy to not only upset the existing global order, but to unseat it as gently as possible. In this we had the secret support of, what is now referred to as the 99%. But powerless as usual, the teeming billions had appointed us, enlisted us to carry out a sequence of events.


Although ultimately, there were to be 7 of us in total to run through this itinerary (which we were expected to survive), at the outset of the journey there were only 3. 


Names are unimportant, but for the sake of pointers the initial three were Mr. S, Mr. T, and Mr. U.


Tonight, It was Mr. S's turn to drive. The mission was planned to the point that, Ideally it could be executed to a T without having uterred a word between the teammates, but contingency made the adventure, and dialogue worth it. 


Although it helped that they were born with telepathic abilities and could communicate just with their extended feedback sense over a radius of about a kilometer.


The Chinese had promised the coordinates to our first destination, and they delivered, so while S and U waited in outside the Embassy in Delhi, Mr T transcribed them to the rest from the inside the only lead-lined room in the building; a handshake later they were riding the X4 out of Chanakyapuri. Mount Kailash could not appear sooner.


Thumbnail had already okayed the first leg of the run, so it was jarring to hear the radio in the car crackle unexpected as her breathy voice broke, "uh, guys i think we might need to reroute you", the sun had by now completely set and the light from the streetlamps  seemed to bounce off the asphalt in an attempted suicide into the hot June air above. 

"No way", cried out S as he hit the brakes, stopping the SUV halfway across a literal  speed-breaker.


"There been a cloudburst, we're still getting the data"


They shared a knowing glance which, between themselves, could be triangulated to a single note of celestial music, announcing the presence of certain entities they were not only well aware of, but had expected and prepared for. 



The trio effortfully refrained from a collective smile at this auspicious catastrophy.
