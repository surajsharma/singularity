as far as narratives go, this was one to behold.

at first, i dreamt that people were asleep while i had woken up, so i treated their sleep as entitled entertainment and my meditation deepened as a result.

miraculously, or as a result of meekness and deference for their sleep, my wakefulness did not disturb their sleep much but a few were distracted for a while.

however, i belived, even in the dreamstate that watching others sleep and dream dreams is a perverted entertainment, so i focused on increasingly focus on my meditation rather than outside. there was nothing left to do.

perhaps, i thought, what could've been the greatest achievement of humanity was pissed on by these folks, was slept on only because of mere ego, a tiny figment of man's imagination. perhaps it was shame and social conditioning that had, with my arrival, hardended into religious opposition of their status.

to call a spade a spade, this story is not just about racism, but stay-in-your-placism. a manipulative tussle over control, or the illusion thereof, but one that could not be discussed in openly, because of, what i could only understand as taboo, denial, or cringey narrative that forced the other to feign intransigence.

i guess there are always exceptions to the rule, i guess there are examples of meditations gone awry but mine was quite rewarding, more than it was humiliating.

for someone who sufferred the wrath of hell on earth over a single tweet, i was lucky to be alive and functioning in the 35th summer of my life. afraid as fuck, i complied with the diktats of the junta that had trapped me, was stealing my data, vitals, and thoughts via satellite , had hushed and trapped my parents in a divorce-grooming, money-laundering, feces-eating cult.

aliens would have thanked me for at least asking an interesting question, if any, but things went feral with the humans. a mob is always a group of dangerous loners and sad people. the function of a mob is always to leave you all alone in the world. i sufferred it all in silence more out of respect than any expectations from democracy.
    
while expecting a mercy killing, i no longer waited for luggage to arrive - my wait had transcended.
    
the fact that no one dared speak about it had, by now given me ptsd which i tried my best to manage with mindfulness and constant meditation.

4-5 years into the narrative - which, depending on context and opinion, was either a cult or a grooming gang, or both - my meditation contiuned on a steady footing, unconcerned with whether or not i was being poisoned. it was mostly all smoke and mirrors while i witnessed wall street culture up close.

what i won out of it was, in my definition, true religion, something truly personal which grew the more i shared it with everyone. so of course, it pissed organized religion off and they wished me dead. it was a fair bargain, i was in some sense, lucky. i guess this kept me going.

recognizing my self had upset some balance, i sat in peace eating into my punishment which was doubt, noise and more narrative. my punishment was of mythical proportions and uncalled for, but i aquiesed and vowed to treat women better than i was accustomed to, for mostly they amplify the negative in any confusion.

there was distinct notion of knowing that there can be no moving on without completely and utterly forgiving entities and identities without and within, so i did it.

i achieved true nutrality amidst chaos. but the science done was hushed because somone's religious sentiment was hurt, i found humility in the fact that i could upset established religion with just a tweet, martin luther would be proud.

i also grieved over their apparent loss of a "right", which I had done nothing to steal. i merely entertained the faint idea that perhaps i was being denied of the very right i was being asked to return - how bizzare!

a right that could be decimated with a tweet isn't much of a right to begin with, just another fiction we tell each other to sleep with a semblance of security.

maybe out of that tweet, a manuscript wanted to emerge, but i was too busy meditating and from within my pitiable, rent-seeking situation and self-effacing public service, raking in the ill gotten gains.

and for all this fuss and misery, ostensible corruption and amoral connotations i was being manipulated into extending life by quitting tobacco, something i had no interest in even trying.

in exchange of perpetual surveillance, some wanted to placate and enthrall me before death, but didn't know how to forgive me for something i didn't do.

i wasn't sad for the racism executed against me because i was unsure or felt inferior because of my skin color but because of my conditioning, which i was steadily losing, of looking upto the white man for #leadership .. as if my illusion that white ppl were children of a superior god had shaterred alongwith my ego .. there was no god and no #leadership or guidance to be found here, so i stayed put, searched within, all the while dreading what the future had in store.

in another sense it was my self that was the ultimate racist in this game, who was sapping the very life out of all racial divides, upsetting some old school gentry, rewriting history of prejudice, accepting my share of everything as calmly as i could.


1) ALL BIG WARS COME IN PAIRS

- now i eat the very fag end of western civilization and excrete the humble beginnings of the most pernicious and destructive of wars ever witnessed by humanity. 

- through my tortures and woes will be born a campaign so misunderstood, by the time people come to terms with its beginning, the damage will have been done - at the end of the short lived but intense skirmish will commence the never-ending-war, which will culminate in multiple global thermonuclear events, leaving mankind, or what is left of it - to reassess its future once and for all. 

- and for all this, i will still be the crying clown, trying to stop the never-ending-war before it begins, suffering to no end so people may come to their senses before it is too late. waking up so i may ease the hurt when it finally arrives. 

- it is funny how small acts of irrational exuberance can snowball into galactic catastrophies, you just need the right bunch of people to begin with. for me, the cast of characters couldn't be more perfect.

- i am writing these words while at the mercy of obsessing entities, who may very well be slowly poisoning my body out of existence. i don't exactly know because, i must confess, i have thoroughly lost the narrative surrounding my life since that tweet. oh yes, the tweet that rendered my soul into an infinite theater for competing interests, my mind transformed into perpetual afghanistan, what could be more seductive to evil?

- i also write out of the fear that indeed, my days on the planet might be numbered so I have to leave some testimony of what happenned here, as much as i am aware of what happenned and as far as memory serves me.

- there isn't a day i don't google phrases equivalent to "how to die" because suicide is increasingly becoming a viable exit option, yet, something in me tells me that thats not how this ends an that i must nurse this coming conflict within me so this exhausted earth might find sustainable, substantial relief from evil and corruption, for a few decades if not more. 

- in short, i have become an object of ideology, sublime only to the extent to which hypocrisy of humanity extends.

- i'm driven to write also out of the sheer ecstasy of being labelled a living god, immortalised to the extent of technology, i write out of gratitude for having become, or having been made into something truly super-human. and i write out of sympathy for those who are jelous that this accomplishment was mine first, they give me hope that a sorry end to this grand experiment might be averted.

1. Defintion:: The technological singularity—or simply the singularity[1]—is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization

According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called intelligence explosion, an [upgradable intelligent agent] will eventually enter a ["runaway reaction"] of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an "explosion" in intelligence and resulting in a [powerful superintelligence] that [qualitatively] far surpasses all human intelligence.

[Kurzweil] reserves the term "singularity" for a rapid increase in artificial intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing for example that "The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... [There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine]

## Law of accelerating returns
- moore's law, dna sequencing

Does the singularity hypothesis deserve to be taken seriously, or is it just an imaginative fiction? One argument for taking it seriously is based on what Ray Kurzweil calls the "law of accelerating returns." An area of technology is subject to the law of accelerating returns if the rate at which the technology improves is proportional to how
good the technology is. In other words, the better the technology is, the faster it gets better, yielding exponential improvement over time.

Some authors confidently predict that this watershed will occur in the middle of the 21st century

For the possibility of a technological singularity poses both an existential risk and an existential opportunity.

the possibility of transcending our biological heritage and thereby overcoming its attendant limitations.

...nonbiological substrate, then there is nothing to preclude the unlimited extension of consciousness

Despite Turing’s prediction, human-level AI had not been achieved by the year 2000, nor was there any sign that it might be around the corner.

The problem with Deep Blue was that it was a specialist. All it could do was play chess. Contrast this
with a typical human adult In short, a human being is a generalist, a jack of all trades. A human chess champion can do a whole lot more than just play chess. Moreover a human being is adaptive

The hallmark of properly general intelligence is the ability to adapt an existing behavioral repertoire to new challenges

Perhaps the foremost requirements for such a machine are common sense and creativity

On one hand, creativity without common sense (as
we’re using the terms here) is nothing more than thrashing
in the dark
common sense without creativity is inflexible

For example, a well-worn analogy with the history of
powered flight likens the first type of machine, the AI engineered from scratch, to an aeroplane. Early designs for flying machines included flapping wings, imitating birds. But
this approach failed. Fixed wings and propellers turned out
to be the best way to get a large, heavy, human-made object
airborne. Similarly, according to the argument by analogy,
artificial intelligence shouldn’t proceed by trying to imitate nature, but by devising a whole new set of engineering
principles tailored for silicon-based computation.

As well as being a viable
step toward the future
creation of artificial general intelligence, whole
brain emulation is touted
as the route to mind
uploading, an important
goal for certain brands
of transhumanism.

## Whole Brain Emulation

In a nutshell,
the idea is to make an exact working copy (or copies) of
a particular brain in a nonbiological (e.g., computational)
substrate.
