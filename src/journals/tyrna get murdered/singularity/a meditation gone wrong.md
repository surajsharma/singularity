# 1 - A Meditation Gone Wrong

   Time out of mind the sand started coming in, first with gentle, slienced sweeps of particles rolling over the sunroofed and cobblestoned courtyard I sat meditating in, then, suddenly, like doubt morphing into a paranoid faith of the cockroach so full of potential its only desire - to burst into flames under the light from the refrigerator door late some fateful friday night - it invited itself into the sanctum sanctorum with ever greater magnitude, shivering intentfully with a singular and orchestrated volition. 

   Its purpose seemed to defy, at once, its inanimate nature, the orders it was following to appear inanimate, and the seeds of the rotting empire its odor represented as it made home in weeping heaps of itself around me.

   Already, I could hear from deep within my meditation someone pleading for an insanity defense. 

   It soon started pouring in from the hole above the small pond besides which I sat. I could hear it turning the clear water into quicksand with a light, defiant drizzle that kept pace with the grains being blown over the floor. 

   Grain by grain it marched in like free radicals announcing the decay of some entity I had perhaps accidentally pissed off, pleased, or otherwise asked cover over on my way to nirvana.

[Obviously this was highly abnormal, I would think every break I would get. During winters the same areas would be covered with snow, and I knew we were not in a desert for the monsoon would still roll by every year like clockwork in a museum.]

   Before long, it started arranging itself on the pillars and temple walls  into a heiroglyphic script I was not yet familiar with. Surely, I figured, someone was trying to mess up my samadhi again. 

    But even with eyes three quarters shut and mind still as a citadel, I could see through its machinations. A face drawn in ripples on the bog that once was my only source of drinking water was gurning so obscenely at the sky that even the lonely waxing crescent seemed like it was trying to hide itself behind a veil of clouds and fireflies. 

   No wonder the feathered trinity perched on their designated spot on the bough of the Crape myrtle - that had erupted from underneath the ground before me on the moment of my first satori, and now stood as tall as a metaphysical souvenir after all these years at the edge of my pond -  had gone eerily silent as if trying to honor its presence.

   Had someone taken a liking to the quality of my silence?

   It didn't take long to understand this love letter from a parallel universe - it was designed to tempt, seduce, cheat, and eventually dupe - now shining like shards of powdered glass under the afternoon sun, now glistening like a termite on a pair of lips hovering threateningly over sand dunes, curved in a smile if only for the loo carrying them afloat. 

[With only wet whistles and dry whispers shared  between them, like a secret language of their own, these foot soldiers were, before i could realize it, dancing for decades in my old stone temple without completely disappearing.]

   For the first few years I entertained it yet another distraction, more evidence of my ever deepening samadhi was this seductive display of mara, but at the same time, I was measuring it, parsing it in all its granular glory, combing through its attitude, sizing it up while wishing it away.

   `When your samadhi starts to deepen, novel distractions appear, and I had witnessed my fair share of them, it was already too late for this nuisance`, so i realized i wanted to engage with the entities present, all 6.6 trillion of them that stood there with the shamelessness of a child enjoying its own rape.

   "I have a compulsion, dear sojourner", I felt like addressing the grains from my posture, "to discount cries seeking help and attention, I offer no duels here, go away.", but I didnt, and not on a singular occasion. For to indulge in power play with intergalatic stuff was not my intention.

   I just sat there, samadhi already half broken after thirteen years of this unwelcome distraction, chiding myself for not being able to recall this menacing stranger at my door.

   Even from my squint I could tell the script was not earthly, was any of this real? If indeed it was mara, should I break samadhi and indulge? Never, of course, so It there for a few more ages.

   As the years rolled by, so did the sand, arraging and rearranging itself into infinitely new shapes and faces and words all around me while the heiroglyphic manuscript on the pillars around us remained the same.

   Until one winter morning, when it's tired dance had slowed to a irritated stomping of the slurry that had resulted as a result of all the snow, when the feathered trinity had flown away and even the snow laden branches of Tulasidas - the only vegetation on my himalayan compound -  had melted, the sand made a symbol that jolted me right out of my frigid, meditative stupor.

    The symbol represented what is known in tantrik circles as the "shoulder surfer's loop". Somewhere out in the desert, underneath a leafless sandalwood tree stand two transfixed, emaciated and ancient looking naked beggars facing each other, perpetually sharing information through their eyes that glow with all the colors of myth and lore as they watch, transfixed, over the cirumferences of each other's ebony and ivory bowls, which are filled to the brim with a mercurial liquid reflecting the passing information.Â 
   
>   Green-eyed snakes hang from the tree's naked branches, occasionally dipping their forked tongues into their bowls (reflecting their original faces), making the beggars enter states of seizure and ecstasy, plasma shooting from their extremities like thunderbolts heralding the end of an epoch in some faraway galaxy. 
   
   From time to time, certain adventurers have tried to photograph or otherwise time the recurrence of such seizures, none have succeeded. 
   
   I was jolted because I recognized the symbol. It was, precisely, the logo of the now rather infamous Flying Snakes Insurance Company of New York. 

   I refrained from smashing my palm against my face. It was, I presumed, the work of my old gang. I finally opened my eyes fully and watched the sand dissolve into the thawing snow for the next few months until all I had left was a thoroughly wet cobblestoned courtyard, and my mind once again filling up with fond memories of past lives enjoyed.

"I mean there's no guarantee, i'm sorry"


"What the fuck are you on about? I thought this was an insurance company"


"Now, maybe you don't understand this entity that visited you, but even if you do, you have no clue how dangerous that place is, can't even get there in a single lifetime, you need.. attempts.., do you understand? hello! you've just been visited by hell and you want to go there?"


"listen, there are places even music starts to sound like a punishment, and i'm talking good prog rock here like Toad or something... to say nothing of the journey"


"oh please, my dear prog rock is already punishment enough"


"be that as it may, i would advise against any such adventure, besides, aren't you already way in over your head with the, uh, what have yous"


"huh i thought that debt was paid, i'm surprised at your hesitation"


"my reluctance is proportional to your curiosity, really are you that bored?"


"something fails to add up here"


"what?"


"i cannot recall it"


"man, fuck your nostalgia, this isn't.. this isn't a controlled stunt, you understand? this isn't one of your "music to rob goldman sachs to" playlists, this isn't one of your props, you stand to lose more than your priviledges here"


"alright alright, i hear your concerns, I guess I just got distracted for a bit there."


"you're damn right, i've been hearing how the price on your head doubles with each breath you take on this planet, why mess about stuff at the other end of the galaxy? aren't you worshipped by enough cultures here that you want to try to impress her?"


"it isn't about her, i guess i just got carried away with the spectacle of it all"


"precisely, you need to forget it. besides its personal, my business depends on you not knowing certain facts about it, and while i'm being honest, I would rather you didn't know them for your own good, if not mine."



... 

"what if i told you ... the thing wants to be proselytised? or at least it ought to be"


"you're thinking with your balls again!"

... 


That night, dreaming on the flight back..


"Tantrik, you've already been sacrificed at the altar of chance, why not indulge?"


"What could you offer me but more toes to step all over? More trains to drive over even more eggshells?"


"Pity"


"Indeed"


...


"How about a number? Your favourite one, make it yours and rule the world"


"Fascinating"

In the absence of something write home about, people will resort to lying..
