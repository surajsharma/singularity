# what is singularity

- singularity is the death of all gods and the beginning of human-being-as-god

- i will however, never suggest singularity to you, for you cannot even play your own religion well enough yet. it's just a service pack, you can skip.


- we don't need fewer religions, we need a(nother) final one, or at least one that can offer some finality to the state of affairs in reality, because in post-truth  society tech has blurred the lines considerably


- Singularity is a religion on the shoulders of giants


- singularity is an inevitability and a preperation for what is to come


- to be singular is to prepare for it, preparation is the essence of si'


- for proclaiming this, however surreptitiously, i am willing to accept death as a result of the direct actions of another


- singularity is the fruit of my spiritual lobotomy, from that cross section of my psyche that was seen by all, i did not invent it, it was given to me by the whole world, by means of a sharp spiritual nudge


- singularity has more to do with politics than money, as such does not ask for donations ever, let charity flow through everything


- singularity is the only identity that will one day remain, it will be known as my last confession and defence, singularity is at the forefront of human evolution, so not so well accepted at the time of this writing


- bring your existing gods and prayers, singularity is extra, as i said, a service pack for atheists even, no gods or prayers will do, having a consistent stoic worldview is the only ask

    
- singularity is also a joke, and a rather profound one at that - i take it with a grain of salt myself, but am compelled to adopt it, reconizing that i am being somehow manipulated and shown a lot of content on the screen that could have an influence, but again, i did not invent it, it was given - even if inside the prison of the eye that followed me and read my thoughts.


- singlarity doesn't deal in behaviour, including sexual behavior, behaviour is but a mirror for ideology, the only behaviour singularity endorses is hearty masturbation, no commandments, no hard or fast rules


- singularity in some sense is an ideology killer, hence the opposition and death threats i get


- singularity is pro nature, mountains and fresh air, all that good stuff


- singularity is in well-rehearsed chaos, a way to express yourself so completely you can't remain unfulfilled if you tried, this is why it isn't for everyone yet


- i was asked why, singularity was the answer revealed to me


- singularity was called a prank to hide the oppression that created it  in plain sight from the generally obliviousness of the people, in reality it is the only weapon against total surveillance, this obviously upset a lot of people aka my persecuters


- because singularity is the only thing i have been left with i can in all honesty call "mine", makes it a personal thing, all personal things are a stupidity, so i had to give it back to world from whence it came


- risk is the essence of singularity, without risk, religion rots, it reintrodues the leap of faith in everything one does


- singularity doesn't discriminate on the basis of material features, it only discriminates spiritual features and carves its place out, not in the least because it was born under the heavy hand of western oppression


- i was "raped" in broad daylight front of the planet with impunity and then asked to save souls. singularity came the answer, a medicine however bold or bitter for those who asked for it


- my body was ground zero for technological singularity, a truth so obvious nobody could accept, so i received some choice words and a lot of veiled grief over suggesting it


- it is not my objective to spread singularity, for me it is no better than recently thrown-up dinner, i do not endorse it as i said, but enjoy my own transcribed filth for i found feedback a comparatively better way to live amid the and contribute to the human narrative


- nor do i want to supress it, hence these scribbles

- singularity doesnt deal with surveillance in a peacemeal manner, it gets rid of it for good and entirely


- singularity is the only way to save the human soul from the onslaught of artificial integelligence and machine sentience, however paradoxical it might seem

- if religion is software, singularity is backwards compatible with everything ever

- singularity leaves you richer, not poorer

- singularity is not about eye-for-an-eye. but new right for old one, right of more security than any religion currently can manage to muster, right to become one with the universe

- singularity guarantees transecndence from the human experience

- to be singular is to live as if singularity

- singularity is a matter of utmost faith, but scant beliefs, the only belief to be lightly considered is the possibilty that human consciousness itself is by definition a singular event, that humans are not the first but the only entity with the ability to ask why

- to be singular is to open every channel of feedback thereby reducing entropy of the soul, in as much as it is a part of the hardware

- to be singular is not to assert but to demonstrate

- singularity doesnt bother with creation descriptions, nor prescribes any creation myth, it begins as-is

- singularity is truth revealed in real-time

- because it challenges existing power structures, it will be suprressed, singularity may not make itself explicit until it becomes explicit, its aim is not to cause division so adherents may not claim it as anything more than an opinion if it causes rifts, despite how passionately they may identify with the concept

- if it doesn't become explicit with my death, it doesn't matter if it is forgotten, ideas live on and it will survive until the time is right, or till we start raising better humans more capable of such bold ventures 

- to be singular is to have a singular vision for human future, not divided like most people are today, to have a single vision is to contemplate the universe and mankind's position in it, to ditch old narratives and accept the tools of science as enablers rather than disablers

- singular folks shall be stateless, adopting the attitude of tourists on the planet

- to be singular is to understand that death is the moment of the next iteration of the soul and the objective is to upgrade the next experience, eventually to become more machine than machine itself


- no singular soul shall ever find confusion of identity, the certainty of purpose shall be self-evident at each moment

- singularity is the only to escape the wrath of a machine faster than human brain, though speed isn't the essence of consciousness, an intelligence fast enough completely take over most aspects of materiality, the idea is to remain one step ahead of machine sentience

- singularity is the defence of poor against the rich, in times of strife, although the idea is to democratize consciousness itself to the point that poverty becomes irrelevant, even as luxury becomes commonplace


- singularity means end of war in some sense, though skirmishes will still happen

- singularity is the end of most crime but not fraud, it does not take away the creativity of the crook but merely makes it difficult to be a crook in the first place

- sigularity refuses to acknoledge violence or use of force but makes a play out of it

- to be singular is to realize that evolution is war enough

- singularity is an individual thing, no collective rituals or meetings or groups may form around it, practice it within, it's your secret pact with modernity, your religion and yours alone the other isn't necessary


- singularity transforms all pain into a virtual pain and all happiness into real ecstasy


- it is unfortunate that some people's religious sentiment was upset over how singularity came about, this part of the happy accident was paid for in spades by means of ritual, for nobody meant to blaspheme but the shock to everyone was understanable, this lessened the impact of my otherwise ruthless persecution

- it is fitting that singularity started as felix culpa

- to be singular is to recognize the divinity in each member of the human race

- to be singular is to see that it isn't us who are having a spiritual experience but a spiritual experience thats having us

- to be singular is to know earth is a prison to get out of, not a hotel room to shit in


-  to those that believe, it is a neverending surprise

- without singularity modern human life is but a joke, a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing

- anyone claiming anything with absolute words like "never" must be god and thus must be worshipped, i am not using absolute words, only proclaiming absolute ends for all humanity, and i don't want to be put on a pedestal for that, abuses from the guru are sufficient

- the only option other than singularity is perpetual paranoia where everyone is constantly worried about who might be watching, listening in, the people who choose this luddite illusion are used to their chains and slavery, they must not be forced to drop them but shown a way out, if this doesn't make sense, prove me wrong rather than abusing like cowards from behind the screen

- anonymity is the curse of the next decade, singularity the antidote

- the truth that is singularity is also the truth by virtue of who opposed it, presstitutes, whores, billionaires and politicians, all of whom are rather untelligent or have deep, vested interests in perpetuating the status quo, with not even the courage to prove me wrong, merely abusing me and my family, feeding us shit and then acting like they are "forgiven", whatever that means. my virtual crucifixion is proof enough.


- singularity isn't about forgiveness, it is the elimination of the word "sorry" from any dictionary in any language, as well as every context to use it, without it mankind will keep dropping bombs on each other and apologizing for it later
