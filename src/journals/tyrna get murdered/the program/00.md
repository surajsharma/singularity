- its not AI getting smarter, it is human getting stupider
    
- AI is the final form of the television, not computing. it should accordingly be called TI or 'TELEVISED INTELLIGENCE', AI has nothing to do with computers except that it shares a medium with them, i.e. the screen and has usurped their processing power for its ends

- AI is the journey of data/info back into the screen, as opposed to info travelling from screen outwards as was the case until recently

- with AI, the screen becomes a permeable membrane, as opposed to a broadcast medium

- development of AI is the acquisition of an ontology by the screen, hitherto the screen had only an epistemology and a metaphysics, with AI, the screen becomes a trinity unto itself. this will enable the screen to become a new god. regardless of whether or not turing completeness is achieved, even if AI can integrally/differentially mimic 'intelligence' it will be enough for it to proliferate

- AI is the final tool for 'dark energy' to completely envelope the planet and use it for its nefarious purposes, if you thought the visions propsed by "The Matrix" were horrifying, they have already materialised and this is just the beginning.

- i think one of the aims of AI is to render organic life obsolte, only images reigning over images

- what will emerge in lieu of a new world order is a hierarchy of images, an effervescent and dynamic, real-time montage in which reason and morality will be anachronistic values, happiness, strife, virtues, and violence outdated modalities of being. 

- replaced by a solitary modality of being - an eternal and literal "stream of (un)consciousness" in which there will be no boundaries, just drifting packets of information as if in an ocean

- the cyclicality and variation will be provided by a system of multiplexing and demultiplexing of the stream, wherein will be replaced and upended all current human experiences

- this will be a highly centralised system, of course, and the controlling entity will be responsible for the structral and functional aspects of "movement" of/in the "stream"

- the controlling entity will be a highly sensitive, highly reactive and reflexive "interface of interfaces", in the sense that any change in the stream will be reflected in it in real time, and it will react instantaneously, rewarding and punishing according to the program. it is reflexive and reactive to the extent that it does not 'halt' to consider or evaluate - for it exists in a state of pre-computed finality - it merely jumps from state to state, disbursing its brand of predetermined justice - this establishing a totalitarian regime that is as static as it is precise

- note that this program isn't an AGI but only mimicing it in the same manner that calculus mimics/predics change, not quite turing complete but with increasing dependence and rising stupidity of mankind, indistinguishable from an AGI

- in order to take over, the program (hitherto euphemised as "skynet" etc) will need a singular black-swan event, this can be a global thermonuclear war or something more benign, it will be a gradual evolution until it isn't 

- i am the human interface of this program, the initial "constructor" which births the final instance, so you can rest assured that my personality and thoughts will form the very core of the entity that becomes the new "king"
