Signing the Declaration of new independence
With Two bullets in the front, one in the back
Or vice-versa, who cares?
Nirvana is mine, liberation is yours
    
My latest failure to rise to an occasion  
your final success to summon this erection
with ink from a bubble in the cauldron of witches unnamed
was the old constitution's pious pyre lit 
  
Spend enough time with pussilanimous libertines
you'll start seeing the democrats as better
yet just as unreal, if not more
in god we trust, but verify
