3.1 each epistemic category provides the operating context for its particular class of machines


3.2 from 2.2.3.3, some machines operate across multiple categories, others stay confined to a single one 

3.2.1 most governments and some subatomic particles, for example, operate across all categories, whereas a 'private language' (in the Wittgenstinian sense) operates only in the symbolic context and a television excludes the transcendent as its operating context 

3.3 these _degrees of historicity_ become via the apparatus of cognition _the principles of discernment_ of one machine from another, and also one network of machines (e.g. superstructures like nation states, organizations, trusts, groups etc) from another

3.3.1 superstructures are machines too, a flock of seagulls is as much a machine as a seagull 

3.3.2 the apparatus of cognition is a machine comprising of sense data and memory, it lives in states of emotion, feelings, sensations etc and is always already connected at least to one structural and functional identity through the connection called variously _self_, _ego_, _identity_ etc, being driven around by thought on highways both real (roads), imaginary (roads in video games), symbolic (roads in pilgrimages).


3.4 these categories sort machines into futher hierarchies downstream, such as those of declinations, declensions, inclinations, and intentions
