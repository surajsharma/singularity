3.1 each epistemic category provides the operating context for its particular class of machines


3.2 from 2.2.3.3, some machines operate across multiple categories, others stay confined to a single one 

3.2.1 most governments and some subatomic particles, for example, operate across all categories, whereas a 'private language' (in the Wittgenstinian sense) operates only in the symbolic context and a television excludes the transcendent as its operating context 

3.3 these _degrees of historicity_ become via the apparatus of cognition _the principles of discernment_ of one machine from another, and also one network of machines (e.g. superstructures like nation states, organizations, trusts, groups etc) from another

3.3.1 superstructures are machines too, a flock of seagulls is as much a machine as a seagull 

3.3.2 the apparatus of cognition is a machine comprising of sense data and memory, it lives in states of emotion, feelings, sensations etc and is always already connected at least to one structural and functional identity through the connection called variously _self_, _ego_, _identity_ etc, being driven around on highways both real (roads), imaginary (roads in video games), symbolic (roads in pilgrimages).


3.4 these categories sort machines into futher hierarchies downstream, such as those of declinations, declensions, inclinations, and intentions etc. As interesting as these hierarchies are in themselves, for the purposes of this text we shall consider language as a machine/tool without much emphasis on linguistic relations, our primary interest would remain the cartography of this metaphysical kingdom, followed by the concept of configuration. 

3.4.1 just as a counter cannot be made without numbers, legends in metaphysical maps cannot be constructed without using the configurations of singularity (self, identity...), duality, trinity and so on. as described in 3.3.2 the _self_ or singularity of psychosomatic "oneness", is one such config, the duality of a childhood friendship, or the holy trinity others.

3.4.2 such identities of identities form the landscape above which levitate circular, indeed string-like rings of _assignation_ and _association_, grouping machines further into categories ad infinitum - a movement of these rings so far correlates strongly with the movements of '_grounding_' and '_decentering_' in personal and public psyches, these structures are unreal in themselves but assume psycho-social reality in operation and execution
