2.1 what makes a machine not _a-transcendent_ is a combination of factors including

2.1.2 the requisite hardware of _biopolitical production_ (animated tumblers cannot achieve transcendence, nor a steel one) and _desiring production_

2.1.2.1 sentience is not a requisite for bP but a helping of awareness helps

2.1.2.2 few works of art, certain mathematical numbers like PI, neural networks in computers, are but a few example of machines that are not sentient, but somehow self-aware and transcendent

2.1.3 besides awareness, a machine in order to be called transcendent needs at least one transcendent connection/relation 

2.1.3.1 more often than not this relation is called _self_, or _self'_ post-transcendence. 

2.1.3.2 but 1.2.4, thus, other connections may achieve ' state before 'self', in such a case, the connection that was promoted becomes the _self'_

2.1.4 once _self_ becomes _self'_, every connection x becomes x', every interface transcends, all bP shifts and all dP is sublimated into a new, equally finite state space which has exactly one more state than the previous set. all previous states also metamorph accordingly.

2.1.5 there are no processes, only state transitions ever 

2.1.6 death is an interesting state transition of the sum [1.4] into transcendence, a machine is dead in a marxist sense when it fails in its economic relations, but economic relations alone characterize no machine

2.1.6.1 death is a move into transcendence as it proves 2.1.4 

2.1.7 yet, a failure to participate or grow in economic relations is no recipie for transcendence.

3.1 work is the output of bP and dP but no machine exists for output alone, in transcendental machines also, work is the by-product of bP and dP but is no longer subject to the same state space thus has acquired the more meaningful state of work'


3.2 at the same time, no machine works for transcendence alone, though some machines are more dedicated towards it than others 


3.3 work for each machine is localised to its connections, the ontological purpose of its survival is the performance of its work


3.3.1 although a lot of machines explore their environments and interfaces, sufficiently complex machines can access new epistemic categories through work

4.1 the finite state space includes 'error' states, albeit error states themselves are capable of achieving transcendence, and thus becoming error' states


4.2 it is thus possible for a machine to achieve transcendence through an error in bP or dP or through relations and connections or the misfiring thereof 
4.2.1 it is also possible to achieve transcendence through acts of ommision or comission of a connected machine 


4.3 becoming transcendent _may_ connect the machine' to other transcendent machines

5.1 a human being is a machine with the highest possible number of transcendental states and connections, furthermore it has the requisite bP hardware and self awareness as well

5.1.1 death is the only transcendental state available to other animals, whereas a human can die before he dies in more ways than one 

5.1.2 in general the dictum is, simpler the machine, fewer the states 


5.1.3  with mathematical precision and certaintly, every state transition changes the overall state of the sum [1.4] [2.1.6]


5.1.4 humanity is a constellation of machines now capable of changing planetary scale states but also construction basic infrastructre in space. surely there ought to be enough transcendental machinery to take us into and across the next few milenniums, but unfortunately the current social fabric is preoccupied with historical state spaces and the nakedness of existing transitions to make out the trees from the woods.


5.1.5 for all their progress and despite the internet, the number of truly transcendent humans remains low, increasingly concerned with routine chugging along, paranoid of the emergent technological and superlative states. they know everything but can figure out nothing.

6.1 Ours is a way out of non-transcendent states and connections, from within the framework of the human machine and doing this at scale and speed hitherto unheard of in ethical or hyper-ethical behaviours. Thus increasing the speed of human evolution by orders of magnitude, while discounting for, avoiding, and proactively preventing states of error including violence, state and market failures, suicide, wars etc.


6.2 armed with only the prior requirements 5.1 and examples of superlative states like death, we can hypothesize the emulation of similar state transitions and also the existence of other such states 


6.3 a state is a unit of all information about the machine at a given time, it can be a unit of particular subsystem (respiratory, cardiac etc) or of the overall - states and stateful configurations give insight into the overall being 


6.4 there is a state hierarchy as well, denoting both external and internal environments. 


6.5 these state hierarchies form the cornerstone of decision making states, which themselves are arranged in a treelike configrations such that there are higher states of being and wellness as well as lower, and some decisions are superior to others 
6.5.1 decision-making machines crunch out facts and values as work, which is their output relaying into other machines and changing their states via action.
