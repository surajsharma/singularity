4.1 types of connections
![classification_relationships](../../../../attachments/classification_relations.svg)

4.2 all machines appear to be connected to other machines, and these connections extend all the way within (and without) until all the categories of consciouness make an apparently seamless whole which is a network seemingly indestructible and pervasive as to appear impervious to reductive faculties

4.2.1 the idea of a machine unconnected from others is unteneable for the same reasons a 'private language' is unteneable (see 3.2.1), even fictional apparatus is connected to the humdrum of the real via the parallax of symbolic and imaginary. every quark, blade of grass, and drop of ocean is eternally networked.


4.3 machines are 'conscious' to the extent that their connections can discern this network

4.3.1 it is such discernment that turns imaginary networks into real and symbolic and vice-versa. thus, a wolf's consciouness is by and large limited to the pack, a buddhist monk's to the sangha, on offline computer knows only itself, and a comb tooth in exile from the comb becomes a decentered machine at once more and less useful than a comb

4.3.2 sentient machines exist in a state of stochastic ergodicity, thanks to their identity connection, whereas for non-sentient machines the primary state of being is more markovian. bearing in mind 1.4.2 which implies the bounds (including bounds of irrational and erroneous states like madness etc.) of rationality

4.3.3 sentience and consciousness are somewhat different callings of the identity connection, in that while sentience means awareness of only localized sense datum, consciouness is a non-local feedback loop within sentience

4.3.4 as the networked consciousness grows, individual and group behaviours take on a multiplicity of states. such as hunting in groups, waging wars, technological innovations and so on.



4.4 connections are relatively simple machines grounding machines into states of self and other


4.5 a machine's connections assign state to its structure 

4.5.1 state is, for the most part, synonymous with function. a function is a series of states seen frequently in a linear succession or a state is a snapshot of a function during execution. candidly, function is _the_ state of being machine.

4.5.2 a migrant laborer performing morning ablutions on the railway track is in a state assigned by the socio-economic connections with the machine that is the track, the biopolitical connections between the body and the sun, and the connection of desiring production assigned by the machine that is the day and so on.

4.5.3 connections are as innumerable as there are machines and can at best be grouped into numerable categories as illustrated above 

4.5.4 the key idea in substituting function with state is to weaken the concept of process, there are no processes, only state transitions ever 

4.5.4.1 processes are as illusory as constellations, which is to say only symbolic and abstract, they are neither machines, nor connections. only a label given usually post-facto to state transitions observed repeatedly 


5.1 To hypothesize a complicated machine, consider a self-replicating 3d printer, although simpler and more elegant examples are available - such as rivers and valleys. Succinctly, simplicity is a guiding tenet for the study at hand, as is their _parallax configuration_.

5.1.1 modality of cognition from 3.3.2 is configured in a manner analogous to RGB values across a matrix representing an image. in that it can be said to be a configuration of one or multiple (parallaxed) layers of meaning. The trinity of 2.2.3 has however a fourth fundamental modality that isn't as glamorous nowadays.

5.1.1.1 to call transcendence a 'hidden' factor in everyday life would be to rob science of its due credit, especially in the post-quantum days. hardly so, however even the basic categories are so ill understood that it comes as no surprise.

5.1.1.2 if it is difficult for clergy and laity alike to see a river as a machine, consider their plight if asked to imagine the (concept of) an uncanny valley as an automaton. not only this, to truly measure the scale of this field-of-view, glance at the machinations of history in all its glory, ever in motion as the planet it transcribes - replete with its own tools and accesories where every bullet fired is as much a machine as the revolution it was fired in, the person it was fired at, the organs it pierced through, the gun etc. the historical playground was never this 'big'.

5.1.1.3 history however, is rarely transcendent.
