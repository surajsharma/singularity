2.1 basic outline of machine taxonomy 
![tom](../../../../attachments/taxonomy_of_machines.svg) 


2.2 the closest definition of a machine in this context then, is something like an origami sculpture - _a structure "folded" into function(s)_.

2.2.1 just as complex creations arise out of a small number of folding techniques in the Japanese art form, complex machines arise out of combinations, permutations, and repetitions of simpler ones.

2.2.2 what is folded and folded into is not only other machines, but structures of cognition itself - thus, not only protiens fold, but even physical dimensions like time and space, mathematical abstractions, and ultimately, even the epistemological categories arrange as an assortment of bends and creases

2.2.3 the three epistemological categories of real, imaginary, and symbolic are well understood, if not in the current context then in other philosophical, psychological, or sociological discussions

2.2.3.1 transcendence as an epistemological category is easily overlooked in the rough and tumble of diurnal chugging along, nevertheless it is important as a source of all other categories in that it is possible for a machine to not be transcendent but not for an epistemological category. thus, qualia and its praxis (consciousness) are both rooted in concerns beyond the real, imaginary, and symbolic

2.2.3.2 epistemological categories are not sources of episteme but conditions necessary for knowledge to occur, they are the context for knowledge and define the working environment of machines

2.2.3.3 these categories are mutually exclusive but overlap in certain domains
