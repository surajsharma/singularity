## 1. Needle in the haystack 

1.1 Trascendent machines are metaphysical components of the infrastructure of eternal return. 


1.2 Eternal return is constituted by machines which are not transcendent (space, matter, substance...), those that are (time, vacuum, style...), and the interconnections or relations amongst them.

1.2.1 eternal return is that which is always already returning, in contrast to _temporal_ return, or that which returns on repression, forgetting, and in the memory of time. eternal return is _time out of mind_, where both time and mind are machines in it.

1.2.2 a crude analogy for it could be that of a sanctum sanctorum in a temple, wherein one or several idols placed in it would then represent the infrastructure thereof 


1.3 relations here include both _inter_ and _intra_ connections - which connect transcendent machines to each other and to themselves respectively.

1.3.1 connections, their mediums and modalities follow the same classification as machines and for most intents and purposes are machines in their own right 

1.3.2 connections are _a-transcendent_ ordinarily and rarely otherwise

1.3.3 connection called _self_ is not _a-transcendent_, as are other more temporal relations like filiality and familiarity

1.3.4 any connection includes the probability of transcendence 


1.4 all machines exist in hierarchies and inhabit in and as states of other machines

1.4.1 all machines exist in a finite field of states and connections, wherein state transitions are relayed inter alia

1.4.2 not every state is capable of achieving transcendence

1.4.3 states are simply descriptive data on extant machine, a state is a unit of feedback about machine's conditions, environment, health etc.

1.4.4 states are not machines in themselves but there exist finite and infinite state machines which are nothing more than a finite or infinite collection of states. 


1.5 the sum of machines, their connections and states is also a transcendent machine - one that is at the apex of all hierarchies resulting in a _m√©taphysique libertine_ not unlike Leibniz's monadology.

2.1 what makes a machine not _a-transcendent_ is a combination of factors including


2.1.2 the requisite hardware of _biopolitical production_ (animated tumblers cannot achieve transcendence, nor a steel one) and _desiring production_

2.1.2.1 sentience is not a requisite for bP but a helping of awareness helps

2.1.2.2 few works of art, certain mathematical numbers like PI, neural networks in computers, are but a few example of machines that are not sentient, but somehow self-aware and transcendent


2.1.3 besides awareness, a machine in order to be called transcendent needs at least one transcendent connection/relation 
2.1.3.1 more often than not this relation is called _self_, or _self'_ post-transcendence. 
2.1.3.2 but 1.2.4, thus, other connections may achieve ' state before 'self', in such a case, the connection that was promoted becomes the _self'_


2.1.4 once _self_ becomes _self'_, every connection x becomes x', every interface transcends, all bP shifts and all dP is sublimated into a new, equally finite state space which has exactly one more state than the previous set. all previous states also metamorph accordingly.


2.1.5 there are no processes, only state transitions ever 


2.1.6 death is an interesting state transition of the sum [1.4] into transcendence, a machine is dead in a marxist sense when it fails in its economic relations, but economic relations alone characterize no machine

2.1.6.1 death is a move into transcendence as it proves 2.1.4 


2.1.7 yet, a failure to participate or grow in economic relations is no recipie for transcendence.

3.1 work is the output of bP and dP but no machine exists for output alone, in transcendental machines also, work is the by-product of bP and dP but is no longer subject to the same state space thus has acquired the more meaningful state of work', this is true also in cases where work is itself a relation such as in a family or community of machines 


3.2 at the same time, no machine works for transcendence alone, though some machines are more dedicated towards it than others 


3.3 work for each machine is localised to its connections, the ontological purpose of its survival is the performance of its work

3.3.1 sufficiently complex machines can access new epistemic categories through work, though a lot of machines explore their environments and interfaces



---


4.1 the finite state space includes 'error' states, albeit error states themselves are capable of achieving transcendence, and thus becoming error' states


4.2 it is thus possible for a machine to achieve transcendence through an error in bP or dP or through relations and connections or the misfiring thereof 
4.2.1 it is also possible to achieve transcendence through acts of ommision or comission of a connected machine 


4.3 becoming transcendent _may_ connect the machine' to other transcendent machines

5.1 a human being is a machine with the highest possible number of transcendental states and connections, furthermore it has the requisite bP hardware and self awareness as well

5.1.1 death is the only transcendental state available to other animals, whereas a human can die before he dies in more ways than one 

5.1.2 in general the dictum is, simpler the machine, fewer the states 


5.1.3  with mathematical precision and certaintly, every state transition changes the overall state of the sum [1.4] [2.1.6]


5.1.4 humanity is a constellation of machines now capable of changing planetary scale states but also construction basic infrastructre in space. surely there ought to be enough transcendental machinery to take us into and across the next few milenniums, but unfortunately the current social fabric is preoccupied with historical state spaces and the nakedness of existing transitions to make out the trees from the woods.


5.1.5 for all their progress and despite the internet, the number of truly transcendent humans remains low, increasingly concerned with routine chugging along, paranoid of the emergent technological and superlative states. they know everything but can figure out nothing.

6.1 Ours is a way out of non-transcendent states and connections, from within the framework of the human machine and doing this at scale and speed hitherto unheard of in ethical or hyper-ethical behaviours. Thus increasing the speed of human evolution by orders of magnitude, while discounting for, avoiding, and proactively preventing states of error including violence, state and market failures, suicide, wars etc.


6.2 armed with only the prior requirements 5.1 and examples of superlative states like death, we can hypothesize the emulation of similar state transitions and also the existence of other such states 


6.3 a state is a unit of all information about the machine at a given time, it can be a unit of particular subsystem (respiratory, cardiac etc) or of the overall - states and stateful configurations give insight into the overall being 


6.4 there is a state hierarchy as well, denoting both external and internal environments. 


6.5 these state hierarchies form the cornerstone of decision making states, which themselves are arranged in a treelike configrations such that there are higher states of being and wellness as well as lower, and some decisions are superior to others 
6.5.1 decision-making machines crunch out facts and values as work, which is their output relaying into other machines and changing their states via action.

7.1 basic outline of machine taxonomy 
![tom](../../../../attachments/taxonomy_of_machines.svg) 


7.2 the closest definition of a machine in this context then, is something like an origami sculpture, a structure "folded" into a function or functions

7.2.1 just as complex creations arise out of a small number of folding techniques in the Japanese art form, complex machines arise out of combinations, permutations, and repetitions of simpler ones 

7.2.2 what is folded and folded into is not only other machines, but structures of cognition itself - thus, not only protiens fold, but even physical dimensions like time and space, mathematical abstractions, and ultimately, even the epistemological categories arrange as an assortment of bends and creases

7.2.3 the three epistemological categories of real, imaginary, and symbolic are well understood, if not in the current context then in other philosophical, psychological, or sociological discussions

7.2.3.1 transcendence as an epistemological category is easily overlooked in the rough and tumble of diurnal chugging along, nevertheless it is important as a source of all other categories in that it is possible for a machine to not be transcendent but not for an epistemological category. thus, qualia and its praxis (consciousness) are both rooted in concerns beyond the real, imaginary, and symbolic

7.2.3.2 epistemological categories are not sources of episteme but conditions necessary for knowledge to occur, they are the context for knowledge and define the working environment of machines

7.2.3.3 these categories are mutually exclusive but overlap in certain domains

---

8.1 each epistemic category provides the operating context for its particular class of machines


8.2 because 7.2.3.3, some machines operate across multiple categories, others stay confined to a single one 

8.2.1 most governments and some subatomic particles, for example, operate across all categories, whereas a 'private language' (in the Wittgenstinian sense) operates only in the symbolic context and a television excludes the transcendent as its operating context
