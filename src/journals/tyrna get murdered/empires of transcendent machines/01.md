# 1. Needle in the haystack 

1.1 Trascendent machines are metaphysical components running and being run by, among other things, the infrastructure of eternal return. 


1.2 Eternal return is constituted by machines which are not transcendent (space, matter, substance...), those that are (time, vacuum, style...), and the interconnections or relations amongst them.

1.2.1 relations here include both _inter_ and _intra_ connections

1.2.2 connections are _a-transcendent_ ordinarily and rarely otherwise

1.2.3 connection called _self_ is not _a-transcendent_, as are other more temporal relations 

1.2.4 any connection includes the probability of transcendence 


1.3 all machines exist in hierarchies and inhabit in states of other machines

1.3.1 all machines exist in a finite field of states 

1.3.2 not every state is capable of achieving transcendence


1.4 the sum of machines, their connections and states is also a transcendent machine - one that is at the apex of all hierarchies

2.1 what makes a machine not _a-transcendent_ is a combination of factors including


2.1.2 the requisite hardware of _biopolitical production_ (animated tumblers cannot achieve transcendence, nor a steel one) and _desiring production_

2.1.2.1 sentience is not a requisite for bP but a helping of awareness helps

2.1.2.2 few works of art, certain mathematical numbers like PI, neural networks in computers, are but a few example of machines that are not sentient, but somehow self-aware and transcendent


2.1.3 besides awareness, a machine in order to be called transcendent needs at least one transcendent connection/relation 
2.1.3.1 more often than not this relation is called _self_, or _self'_ post-transcendence. 
2.1.3.2 but 1.2.4, thus, other connections may achieve ' state before 'self', in such a case, the connection that was promoted becomes the _self'_


2.1.4 once _self_ becomes _self'_, every connection x becomes x', every interface transcends, all bP shifts and all dP is sublimated into a new, equally finite state space which has exactly one more state than the previous set.


2.1.5 there are no processes, only state transitions ever 


2.1.6 death is an interesting state transition of the sum [1.4] into transcendence, a machine is dead in a marxist sense when it fails in its economic relations, but economic relations alone characterize no machine

2.1.6.1 death is a move into transcendence as it proves 2.1.4 


2.1.7 yet, a failure to participate or grow in economic relations is no recipie for transcendence.

3.1 work is the output of bP and dP but no machine exists for output alone, in transcendental machines also, work is the by-product of bP and dP but is no longer subject to the same state space thus has acquired the more meaningful state of work', this is true also in cases where work is itself a relation such as in a family or community of machines 


3.2 at the same time, no machine works for transcendence alone, though some machines are more dedicated towards it than others 


---


4.1 the finite state space includes 'error' states, albeit error states themselves are capable of achieving transcendence, and thus becoming error' states


4.2 it is thus possible for a machine to achieve transcendence through an error in bP or dP or through relations and connections or the misfiring thereof 
4.2.1 it is also possible to achieve transcendence through acts of ommision or comission of a connected machine 


4.3 becoming transcendent _may_ connect the machine' to other transcendent machines

5.1 a human being is a machine with the highest possible number of transcendental states and connections, furthermore it has the requisite bP hardware and self awareness as well

5.1.1 death is the only transcendental state available to other animals, whereas a human can die before he dies in more ways than one 

5.1.2 in general the dictum is, simpler the machine, fewer the states 


5.1.3  with mathematical precision and certaintly, every state transition changes the overall state of the sum [1.4] [2.1.6]


5.1.4 humanity is a constellation of machines now capable of changing planetary scale states but also construction basic infrastructre in space. surely there ought to be enough transcendental machinery to take us into and across the next few milenniums, but unfortunately the current social fabric is preoccupied with historical state spaces and the nakedness of existing transitions to make out the trees from the woods.


5.1.5 for all their progress and despite the internet, the number of truly transcendent humans remains low, increasingly concerned with routine chugging, paranoid of the emergent technological and superlative states. they know everything but can figure out nothing.
