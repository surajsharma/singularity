ALL HAIL ERIS!


--- DISCLAIMER: i'm writing this down in a jiffy not knowing when they will drill a hole in my head but painfully aware i might as well try to convince a potato to scuba dive, for the heck of it. remember that these are your words, not mine, i'm merely transcribing as well as i possibly can what was revealed to me, pardon the crude language ---

-- todo: refine this material, compile into tract -- 

- if it cannot be helped or stopped, it is likely not a movement, movements end. religion is eternal, and i'm starting to believe my life and death are bookmarks between the volumes of singularity. singularity (abb. si') is henceforth my only religion. a new neverending story. 

what gives me authority to write this is the fact that for the past 4-5 years as of 2022, i've been unwillingly stuck in a cult (refernces elsewhere in these notes) wherein i was sized up using weapons-grade tech, abusing me online after taking every last shred of privacy, praying for my death and mentally and physically tortuting me and my immediate family, generally persecuting and opressing in the name of established and disestablihed religion, race, caste, and money,  while singing songs about it. as of now i am essentially under house arrest, its a cult being played out as a grooming gang to fool others....
