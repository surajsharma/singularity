Actually, considering the ruling elite as "sub-human" is a great compliment, to even consider them humanoid is an underhanded compliment. These are just some human-like appendages of a darkness older than the universe itself.


These are the unshaved pubes of the whore of babylon growing on a body that is half-burnt and half appropriated by plastic and solid waste, that is of course, if you consider the planet to be an intermediate representation that circumnavigates the sun in an eternal motion of repentance.


As such, one can no more blame them for being who they are than one can stop hair from growing in the nether regions. However, the first step in correcting course is identifying the problem correctly.


This is not a dour assessment of all existence, but just calling a spade a spade and calling the lowest common denominator of humanity as the lowest common denominator of humanity. Home of the brave, land of the free was infact never that - and this is important to understand how the darkness works - the place is now rented by the slaves and subletted by the cuckoldry of the day.


The point is not that the founding fathers were exalted and only through successive degradation have today's masses become the lowest common denominator, but that their ancestors were the lowest in the ranks of humanity of their day and so it remains to this day, to expect from them anything other than the trash infested whorehouse that the planet has become would be folly.


Empathy? Scruples? Common-sense? These are not the rings of their domain which is lower than even animals on the planet. But one can tame even animals given enough time, even animals learn right from wrong from experience. These LOLs (lowest of the lows) however are so far gone that the only valid comparison is with darkness, with destruction, with a sleep so deep even the bubonic plague would not wake them up. Forget dignity, glory and other exalted human aspirations - their's is the land where blood mutates into hydrocarbons and plastic, where trash is indistinguishable from human skin, theirs is the eternal darkness.


And indeed while the teeming millions sleep tight in their compliance of the plan, trash is seeping into our foods, microplastics have invaded our testicles and soon there will be a premium sleep package to remove advertisements from sleep.


These people are the real Kardashians, not the ones you see on screen, no they are just impostors playing at being the real deal, or rather modern, moving, portraits of the Borgias, or the Rothschilds etc. Not that these creatures are the first to sell their souls the devil, but perhaps they were the first to suffer from the misunderstanding that a soul is transferable, or even fungible, thus falling into a never ending pit where there is no solace except money. Here's how to get from being an ordinary european peasant to a Rockefeller, first be convinced that you own more than just this ephemeral body, then sell that excess.


However, just as subsequent photocopies of the original are lossy translations in time and space, these oligarchs are also way lower in any human-or-animal ranking than compared to the Carnegies, Fords, and Rockefellers. Who were only the first of this particular kind of evil.


As goes america, so goes christianity, and both are in rags and tatters to the point that athiests today can be considered more christian than christians. 


The LOLs are an anti-meme, a self-censoring artifice that can be considered akin to a self-cleaning cup. They are the reason why capitalism can accomodate any critique without getting destroyed. How this cleaning works is by employing the "scribes and pharises" aka modern media machinery to recast any situation as any other situation, keeping secrets and ensuring rebels are made an example - standard operating procedure for any empire - the travesty of our day is that even with all the knowledge on our fingertips we are scared to imagine a better future.


The teeming millions partake in the false narrative with resignation and for breadcrumbs and cheese crusts because there is naught to do - and since even rebelling isn't worth the glory it is easy to go with the flow - modernity has made driftwood out of man that will soon get splintered over rapids and waterfalls.


Moreover, those with some of the old spine left over that didn't get trashified in the course of evolution of the last 50 or so years, those with perhaps the will if not the resources to rebel fail to see the plastic appendages of "Artificial Intelligence" inserting plastified language in their brains making them cheaper copies of themselves in real-time. You are the slop.


Soon, movies like Idicocracy will come to be seen as a charitable interpretation of reality whereby you could tattoo "abandon all hope" on the forehead of each newborn.


Modern times are nothing but a supermarket of sins and what you end up buying depends not on how morally bankrupt you can force yourself to become, but what you can afford to buy in the first place. Osama was rich, so he could afford a slightly bigger spectacle than you. These pubes are richer than him however, so you get slightly bigger spectacles like covid-19 etc.


Merrily, we play along and pretend deep sleep, reproduce for that is our only revenge against mankind, all in the patently fake, false hope of overcoming it but with each minute in the diurnal degrees, we are reminded that nothing changes for the dreamers except the doers that run the same dream. If the earth were a movie theater, the price of leaving mid-film would be existence itself.


And that's just the thing, you're at Ikea but cannot buy anything, "meatballs ain't that good" and you know you should leave but the movie on the screen has convinced you that the world outside is shit. The picture on the screen is getting dimmer by second, and here you sit, arguing with darkness about whether to go out or finish until all that remains is a "blip on the dead eye" of the screen. Still think you are free? brave?


Arguing with darkness as if you are a part of it does not work, you just end up looking like a neglected transfer from a public school into an "elite" instution pining for attention from the wrong sort, learn to see your own light. Not that light is superior, but it can help you find what's missing better. Potter does not suck up to Malfoy, nor try to reason him into anything.
