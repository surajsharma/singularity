Antisemetism works in mysterious ways. Here you are in territory which is the precise reflection of Lacan's famous defintion of love. In that, antisemetism in so far as it is just pure difference which is the very _reactionary_ nature of every system. Nobody wants to hate the jew just as nobody wakes up one day and decides to build an empire, but gradually, and not in any way that is not quadratic, one finds oneself at odds with the jew for totally unexpected reasons - which goes to prove the wholly virtual nature of both love and hate.


It isn't moral flexibility nor financial pliance that adjusts us for co-existence, but capacity for _abstraction_. If hatred and jelousy are the main characters, then here we can see them clearest in all their naked opaqueness. What counters this is also drive, and not on the same number line, not in cartesian but euclidian space. The art of giving what you _do_ have to someone who _does_ want it - if that sounds a lot like commerce, well then.


Jew is history's beast of burden, if you put your racist goggles on you can see the cargo of white guilt on his back and so on. His problems are not your problems, and it is not wise to wish for another's problems. Nor can one truly ever _learn_ from another's mistakes, one must make one's own but what the image of this raw hate affords us is a generalisation about _all_ hate. Specifically, we learn that it is a wholly virtual abstraction - one of narcissus' masks.


In reality there is nothing special about the Jew, there are older, stranger folk out there, but a youthful lack of culture, which is now rotting in its own neglect, had postwar put the american Jew in a position of a middleman - as one appendage of the "vampire squid" meant for interacting with the judeo-christian or even abrahamic empires in the world at large. 


It would make sense to say here that evolutionary hatred is _biological_ before it is psychological, but the hatred we were dealing with now was passed on by generations so far in history as to be petered down to negligible, most our barriers were merely psychological and superficial. The ill-planned, hasty retreat from Afghanistan, for example, was instructive of the moral panic this fact has caused. Without an underlying reason to fight, without a strong "why", it is difficult to maintain any campaign.


The packaging was excellent because it was standing on the legs of Fordism and Taylorism, back then at least, not only in industry but even in informal situations such as child rearing it was scientific management done right but the end was neither scientific nor well managed, alas, there is no such thing as a death with dignity.


What the jew brought to the table was the illusion of a republic, which in turn powered the illusion of the "constitution", which like a supercar, was meant to go fast but not for long periods. By the end of Vietnam debacle, which was also poorly managed, there were already signs of exhaustion.


Needless to say when it did fall apart into the oligarchy that has become too dangerous for its own good, the Jew was given rank and purse in realms of power in accordance with the lobbying efforts and as discussed, for the natural penchant for market making.


Yet, we return to antisemetism when the abstraction reaches saturation and things start to seem over-abstracted, such as collateralised debt obligations, such as bitcoin.


Now, the mantra of capitalism always was and is how to drive gain from any abstraction, but under over-abstracted conditions, the gains were merely _conveniences_, so a natural retardation was upon them, the law of diminishing returns is the road to war and at the time of this writing, it really did feel as if a civil strife could explode across the face of the entire nation. However, this was not going to happen, because america is dead, and what remains is just some story going around the room. That, and this final report card which is a litany of disemodied phenomenon ranging from merely perverse to wholly unholy. So called bodies without organs, or in other words, the "real problems of fake people". 


The oligarchy that now owns increasingly less land on the continent between Mexico and Canada but yet retains control over means of production is not affiliated with any nation state any more. Which explains the election and re-election of Trump, as one last college try, one last hail mary in order to save the democratic narrative which is in frays. This is not new, the same oligarchy presided over the dissolution of the USSR, but because back then people were a trifle more charactered than today, the veneer protecting the barberism was less obvious.


The average capacity for abstraction is an important metric for evolution for the speed of evolution is decided by it. There is a direct correlation between how fast we get there to how much we can abstract intermediate representations of truth amongst each other. But there is a natural hierarchy which dictates the bullying by rock-and-roll lovers of jazz lovers and that of all music lovers by the "they", the mob as a whole.


Reproduction was, by the twenty-first century, largely evolution-by-bruteforce for humans, what kept the party going was in some sense, the demographic dividend of the baby boomer generation. Generation X were the weak men produced by good times, millenials were given a raw deal so they had to toughen up inside a precariousness, and generation z was going to inherit the gatekept dust.


The oligarchy is of course worse than just a group of dumb businessmen with an emotional quotient lower than their intelligence quotient, and without a individual character enough to be fully considered human, it is rather, like the movie "They Live" which works perfectly for all kinds of ideology. Their entourage consists of a host of "scribes and pharises" that guards their dust for them for a sliver. That is how you get both gulf wars, 9/11, Afghanistan, and a show about a teacher who becomes a drug dealer because of an inability to afford healthcare.
