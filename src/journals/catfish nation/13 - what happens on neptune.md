The toxicity reveals itself in layers - like a mould-infested cake made of stuff found inside a witch's cauldron. The stars and stripes playing hide-and-seek from the flag while downstream and rats plan apocalypse in the sewers while the nations sleep soundly in the security that is their birthright.


The right question here is not why play hide-and-seek, but why are you found only in places like the sewers or the witch's cauldron?


Jimmy isn't simply a lost cause but a toxic one at that. Which further historicises the already suboptimal narrative. 


The logic of all conquest is like traffic, once you get ahead of it, there is precisely nothing there. The powerlessesness of all the money in the world is a lot like this, nothing but a turning void that just says the same thing every day. The economy continues as long as there remains this trickle-down of traffic, and most decidedly not due to the military industrial complex. In fact, the complex is a dated term which should be decommissioned for the oligarchy that runs the command also runs the commanded with the same day to day helplessness. 


What has spawned from this marriage of military and industry is exactly the self-devouring chimera that now has infiltrated the country from wall street's crevices and washington's crannies to the nooks of academia and every corner of main street. The contract with god, if there ever was any, has been pissed into naught. Not only is there no soul left to search, but the search itself has evaporated.  


But "rome on fast forward" comparison simply doesn't cut it. Forget nation state, rome was still a body politic whereas what we have now is little more than a dangerous clown show improvising a scorched-earth in the third act.


It is actually so late in the day that its starting to seem early - classic. The logic of choice was first to invert, a glut of choice occasioned more confusion than anyone had expected, at its peak, materialism cannibalised itself through the very glut of choice it proclaimed to be its core. These days it is not "heaven or las vegas", but rather, "las vegas or las vegas" and outsiders are quickly identified by their android phones. 


Choice is a fake paradigm, billions of videos on youtube but sit down to eat with it and you'll find content has vanished enirely from the platform. Ask any hindu about the violence in choice and they will confirm your worst assumptions.


The entire judeo-christian world runs on this primacy of explicit choice, thus explicit violence - a test of this is the renunciation of nationality or even apostasy, both are acts of supposed violence against superstructures. The point here is that america lives entirely inside this state of perpetual violent apostasy and still believes it has a choice in the matter. If they could, a majority of americans would take up citizenship elsewhere right now, but nobody can run from self.


As someone who spent their entire life at the receiving end of this violence, one still does not keep grudges, however one does settle scores and so my history with Jimmy should itself be called into question but since one is not the subject of this forensic investigation, it is immaterial which of my transcendental axes are being ground here. Long story short here is that we didn't really have a choice, and were thus juxtaposed - Jimmy being Jimmy still manages to find a thing or each day to this day to nag me, I maintain my calm facade and ignore him while trying to come up with a permanent solution to his woes. 


This is not so simple, for he only understands the language of violence, money, and pale complexions - all things I have left far behind in my quests. These days I have surrendered to the common diagnosis for psychopaths, which is that they are incurable. I avoid interaction as much as humanly possible and nod my head in agreement to whatever dumb toxic shit he spews all around me and while the Russians have been kind enough to give me the sobriquet "exorcist-in-chief", I doubt I have been anything beyond modestly successful in that regard. 


Asking one for proof of the topic of each song, each movie, each piece of fiction, fashion, and technology - Jimmy is an old man inside another old man's body sending back food served at the restaurant because the pizza slices were touching each other - this senility is evident across the sociopolitical spectrum.


For the entirety of my life, Jimmy used his "fuck you" money to say "fuck you" to me, my family and my life itself. That of course wasn't the only number pulled on me, nor the only raw deal handed to me - after forty years the condition was such that I am typing this from a hostel bed, nursing my broken back and asking Washington "so, whens the murder?", with each breath.


Previous assasination attempts have floundered when the economic repression and psychological torture didnt work, yet he keeps trying. That should give the reader ample context for the time being into my own motivations to pen these thoughts down.


Nothing personal, and I'm not one to fish for sympathy but just priest reading the last rites for an entire civilization so a little background is likely appreciated. Especially If that civilization is running on his dreams, fantasies, body, bodily fluids, DNA, and thoughts. 


So what do we have here that is new. All empires are evil, all crumble after a fashion. The novelty of the american empire will be remembered in its density, racial arrogance in the face of annhilation, stark absence of self-esteem let alone self-respect, and a slavish worship of the money which is its only culture. There is nothing unique about the abject powerlessness or its exhibition in the form of Trump et al. All empires are powerless towards their end, and like old men, prefer the company of women as age advances.
