A loss of motive marks the end of empire. Greed on its knees in deflationary cycles that can last for who knows how long? The descent will be nothing special until the cold winds start blowing, and given all the apathy in the military industrial complex, the darkness that slept in the absence of light has reared its head mocking institutions into public and private humiliations. 


We're not looking to make the dead alive but make the undead dead again, to no avail other than temporary relief, but lately even the solace from war, crisis, and scandal is exhibiting its diminishing returns. 


Playing within the constraints will lead one to invest in gold and other precious metals, it is a grind but not an ontological freedom that was envisioned. But the logic of material desire inverts and fighting for peace becomes fucking for virginity.


Which is the greater point here, the west's inherent lack of spiritual awareness delivers them unto inferior solutions, at the pinnacle of which stands Christianity. Not to take a piss on Christ, but if I had a Lada I would take better care of it.


In the absence of all science, religion will necessarily enter the mental model of any reasonable individual, but _whose_ religion, even if all of them are ossified clones from hoary pasts. So no, the entire drama isn't about the price of oil, for the car does not run on gas alone.


In their heart of hearts, these people are essentially, religious nutbags much like jimmy, known to act fowl and blame the cold for it. Even geopolitically, the debate on _how_ to use oil rages on.


The gifts of narcisissm of this kind appear late and are always perilous, it wasn't until late in life that Carvaggio started seeing stuff. Meanwhile it is still a vehemently held belief that science or money will make things better. They have seen and named god, and it was a particle.


When a control freak loses, it is never a pretty sight, as a result the history that can be doubted is scaling in resolution and magnitude. 


The everlasting success of religion is in the solace it provides from the absurdist theather life on the planet can quickly descend into. But the downfall from excessive choice and over-abstraction of resources leads directly to the man on the beach who had tossed so many stones into the ocean in his search for the philosopher's stone, that by the time he actually picked one up, he was forced to throw it too out of habit.


It appears that the the airplane is in mid-flight, with only one engine failure whereas in reality their most troubling query from life is whether jet fuel can melt steel. One would call it pathetic, but the fall of the house of usher is nothing but a spectacle beyond judgement. judgement without judgement.


I don't think the teeming millions understand, the facade is inches away from falling into dried maybelline and shit stains. It is  wonder empire finds three legs to stand on and call it the economy, stupid.


Shame and scruples perhaps see the day through. One cannot deny the small part one has played in service of one's agenda to prolong the suffering, perhaps a more upright citizen would have offed themselves by now. Now I had visions of abandoned malls and water-logged arcades, that is where the shame ends.


As for scruples, these are simpletons and never had many, the west is more a village now than ever, which is ironic, if only in New York. Those that still don't see that all empires end in this eternally fucked state only to repeat the same story over another three centuries or so. Circularity is the curse of all empire, including science, including language.


Religion is truly lost on the religious, but religion can save you _before_ crossing the rubicon, and the story ends at the fact that the dead tell no tales. Hollywood lasted how many years again? At the far extreme of their mental spectrums where one sits, one can see individuals who have so thoroughly washed their hands off any self-respect as if to shove one's head up the ass of a rhino in an attempt to become beast. Sad though humans always were, some special cases deserve more love than others without ever being able to earn it.


From inside this "perverse core of christianity" i see nothing but a vacuousness, literally no story, jimmy's internal monologue is an eternal silence jimmy runs from but cannot hide from, hence the barn.


The supreme jealousy harboured against one for being an individual does not a society make. It makes a ghetto, which was extensive in my visions of their future. Truth is stranger than fiction however, because the architecture of this ghetto was supplied to me by the very narcisissm that attacks me.


This is not to dismiss the west as racist whites but that is the essence, and how can you hide behind a color? Hence the guns.


I was told very early on in life that their culture is non-existent, but darkness is a rich culture and evil prevails on the planet in accordance with its pay grade. Meanwhile folks such as your truly casually keep ringing its knell - restoring eternal balance to the world.


Narcissism becomes the religion of the mediocre, envy its operating principle. The image overtakes reality, but like the dog in the meme says, "this is fine".


It is not the case, as is charitably assumed that the drive to become beast led them out of the pains of humanity, rather the intentions were beastly to begin with, which is to say, there were slivers of humanity left here and there at first. But they were by and large exceptions.


The narrative of the frontier to be conquered comes to a halt every time in recoginizing the worthlessness of conquest. From there it's a short skip to where kids are asking, like the Kerri Chandler song, "mommy what's a book?". I should know, I went from collecting terabytes of music to deleting my youtube playlists.
