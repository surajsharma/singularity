Falling resembles flying if the pit is bottomless and it is easier to fall than fly. There is no committee at the bottom, nor perhaps, if we're lucky, any welcoming party on top. Namespaces already polluted by the gaze of the other cannot be earnestly called elysium by any measure, even if that other is God. 


Nor are aliens more important than God even if they exist and God doesn't. But just like not everyone can write smut, not everyone can practice their religion, especially in a public setting. Religion is, more or less horsing around, but it demands a sincerity and commitment the west remains wary of due to their tendency to over-commit, over-compensate, and in the worst cases over-determine.


There is already this insincerity visible in the native americans, which were faux "Indians" only to the extent that they got trampled under the invader's feet. To get disrupted out of existence by an alien force is not out of the question but Jimmy is insincere, which is a repellant to higher life forms.


The maintenance of market cyclicality is exactly the continuation of a hypocrisy that had propelled boomers into their plastic success. Money is not the only bubble that can last forever.

More often then not, this is a repeated civilizational pattern, the ancient egyptians are not present to confirm this sadly but their end was an empiricism of similar latitudes. Or the Babylonians for that matter, or the Sumerians - the first victims of language.


The virus in our minds is not religion but language, and it has grown chthuluesque appendages that are reaching inside our brains
