Falling resembles flying if the pit is bottomless and it is easier to fall than fly. There is no committee at the bottom, nor perhaps, if we're lucky, any welcoming party on top. Namespaces already polluted by the gaze of the other cannot be earnestly called elysium by any measure, even if that other is God. 


Nor are aliens more important than God even if they exist and God doesn't. But just like not everyone can write smut, not everyone can practice their religion, especially in a public setting. Religion is, more or less horsing around, but it demands a sincerity and commitment the west remains wary of due to their tendency to over-commit, over-compensate, and in the worst cases over-determine.


There is already this insincerity visible in the native americans, which were faux "Indians" only to the extent that they got trampled under the invader's feet. To get disrupted out of existence by an alien force is not out of the question but Jimmy is insincere, which is a repellant to higher life forms.


The maintenance of market cyclicality is exactly the continuation of a hypocrisy that had propelled boomers into their plastic success. Money is not the only bubble that can last forever.


Impossible is something, just ask Icarus - "just f***ing do it" is often the war cry of the desperate. But my friends all drive porches, I must make amends and in this comparison is evil born.


At is heart hedgemony is about measuring stuff, including appendages, and keeping score within the generallly accepted paradigm of bigger is better, greed is supreme. This is true from sea to shining sea and not just a localised industry.


The problem is, all measurements are wrong. More often then not, this is a repeated civilizational pattern, the ancient egyptians are not present to confirm this sadly but their end was an empiricism of similar latitudes. Or the Babylonians for that matter, or the Sumerians - the first victims of language.


The virus in our minds is not religion but language, and it has grown chthuluesque appendages that are reaching inside our brains. Religion is the ultimate empire because it forces us to go beyond mere fantasy and be more empirical than the lesser domains of sciences including language. It would not be a stretch to assume empire _is_ empiricism.


The truth cannot be written about, for everything else, there's Wittgenstein's credit card. No sooner does one speak of faith is it corrupted by the limitations of language, which are patently exhibited by the holes in the whole of technology trying to emulate or model language.


If Quine is correct in that "Language is social art", then appropriations would have been futile, but appropriations are wildly successful within all languages.  The empirical virus in our minds is not religion but language, and appropriated via technology, language has grown chthuluesque appendages that are reaching inside our brains, reprogramming it. The empire of language is universal .


Forget how, and ask _why_ did we end up here? The attempts at modelling language are not yet the birthpangs of whatever shall be the offspring of information technology, but the seeds have been sown and sown well. All technology _reproduces_, for example internet was born not out of a wedlock between the telephone and the television and so on.


The technology that is the offspring (or if you hate this analogy 'the next intermediate representation', abbv TNIR) of language and compute is an image, or at least closer to a visual appendage into spacetime. This much is clear but the reason why industries working on turning the eye outward have lagged is a natural fear of observation because like in any conjunction, there is risk (of observation) and all this sounding way too heavy for the baby boomers already.


There is inherent risk in _any_ observation seemes to be the message, so insecurities are not without common-sense. Where common sense ends is where they admit "from dust to dust" and then gatekeep that dust with all the zeal they can muster. 


These gatekeepers of dust, or more colloquially, "time creators" are spirits caught inside the graveyard, looking out. That is all "country" has come to mean, an open graveyard where little else shifts but dirt. If that sounds even remotely romantic, consider that the frame is ghettoised beyond recognition, and not as an existential compromise, but wonder of wonders, as _excess_.


Jimmy's eyes look out from a ghetto graveyard trying to find at least one locus of control but nothing but death stares back, causing further isolation, regret, guilt, and fear as he shrinks into nought.
