A marxist-leninist justification of astrology, a vox populi, demand-driven quest to know tomorrow how much we can fuck around and find out and this demand is generated by an inhrent incapacity of other quests, a logical vacuum fulfilled by a substitution of scientific endeavour, lost in sublimation to language and culture, surviving only by a few data points. Everything is a weapon if you know how to weild it, and thus, astrology is existential weapon par excellence especially these days, though in days of its former glory it was considered less pseudoscientific. 


Scientific endeavour is constrained by the economy in times of fear, and at least bent to the shape of its will during times when greed rules the colective psyche of the planet, which is simply an average in an algorithm. The brutal stifling of innovation, persecution of geniuses, and the murder of intelectuals are the norm in any ruin. Outrage industry booming, their shrugs turned to flexes, flashpoints breaking out anew like acne on mother earth's face as war draws westwards, and Jimmy had been asking for it for a while now as he awaits the next no fly zone. It is like a whale waiting to explode.


Of course the collapse isn't structural at first, the fiddling is fun *before* rome starts to burn, when the knives are out but not bloodied yet. What was magical was it was as if the nation-state itself had "blinked" upon mankind, this was a rhyme history had reserved hitherto. The magician had conscripted all and sundry and everyone dreamt of a winter in which only ash parties for decades.


But astrology is no magic, it only attempts to tell us how the ball goes in the hole, not why. Whether it is war, revolution, scandal, or nothing an accurate prediction can be made but mere punditry won't suffice, for to predict is to also judge and to ask for judgement in return. In that a skill, remunerable and exalting if practiced well.


Although we are beyond the need for it in this iteration of Sid Meyer's Civilisation. No tarot cards or Jungian machinations could satisfy the spectacle, the feast of feasts and the fire of fires that hovered above humanity would consume itself ino an eternal renovation, into a chimera fused into itself with no record of it ever having occured left behind. 


How long can I keep feeding Jimmy morsels of software to keep him from going berserk? How long before NATO dissolves? Consider his fundamental issue with mankind, he does not want hope but hopelessness, not work but misery, not cleanliness but filth. No, he's no longer fiddling rather twerking on the ambulance.
