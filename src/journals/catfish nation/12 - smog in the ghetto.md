Malginant narcs are often found in clusterfucks that resemble a "rat king", sociologically this kind of co-dependence emerges as gangs, cults, and cabals - all of which are apt labels for any final oligarchy.


In particularly, even if the cult or cartels dissolves, there remains a good chance of it returning for malignant narcs like jimmy are vindictive and grudge-keepers.


In the case of true psychopathy, the group never fully formally disbands, which is essentially why marriage had collapsed. Marriage is a kind of narcissitic psychopathy in its own right, however even cultures where it had supposed "staying power", noticed the stark erosion in standards to the extent that in a move of pathetic, counter-psychpathy a "respect for marriage" law was enacted.


The good, bad, and ugly of it all is the fourth state of being, the beautiful. Something they never were, as the botox shall confess. But beauty not in the exalted sense of nearness to god, but even simply functional beauty standards of the country have been flattenned into the lowest common denominator's imagination. Tyranny of numbers simply or is there something else at work?


Clinging to old beliefs is the same rigor mortis that has Jimmy powerless in a barn, shelling stones at dung. This war on common-sense isn't new but it has come to consume Jimmy in these final days. America is a failed state and a failed economy thats carrying on pretence and a hope that the next pandemic or war might help coast the narrative.


End has introduced him to the bottom-feeder that he really is, this exccerbates his desperation. I see him squirm and wither all around me, and in the ghetto masturbatory fantasy that his life has come to be wherein the only thing superlative is sex, if not money. Since there is no longer any irony in his life, Jimmy turns to sarcasm often.


If in Hollywood's imagination, extraterrestrial life forms are given the scary treatment more often than not, that is because they are unforgiving to lower life. So the complete unleashing of truth hollywood has aimed at is an inversion of sarcasm. A complete stripping away of epithets and euphemisms - the contraband of civic life - and indulge in a fantasy of vulnerability. Hollywood was peak cuckoldry, before cuckoldry was famous.


But why does evil persist? Primarily as a catalyst for good, without evil good cannot become better, once you reach any superlative position worth its salt, evil turns to good to worse, without itself changing into anything. This cyclicality is hard to grasp for the linear western mind. Good never becomes evil only worsens into a lesser good over time, but evil is a powerless stasis. Power is thus always weilded by either good or a compromised lesser good because only this part of the equation is ameable to change, to motion, while evil plans forever to take over the world from inside the brain-in-a-vat, howling at perceived enemies from its solipsist cage. This is why the (society of) mind assumes democracy _ought_ to work.


However the society of Jimmy's mind, which we have established resembles an oligarchic, malignant cabal, has been made more insular than characteristically possible for any "empire" in its final doldrums. To their credit, the British were, once again, better at playing losers. This insularity isn't an uncommon symptom of hedgeonic decay, close to the end a clustrophobia envelops the land and the world starts to seem increasingly a prison, the balance of power amongst nations seems to have gone for a stroll, and the legiticimacy of all claims comes into question.


One would think, and very naturally so that this is at least in part the consequence of a connected planet and that the internet and social media have pessed on the pedal of decline, but the actual historical picture on the ground says otherwise, in that public opinion was merely amplified by tech, and not in any way that could upset the balance of power - otherwise the internet is still military-grade technology put in civil hands. The real killer is the apathy of taking thigs for granted, which sets in with age. 


The "clear and present danger" of having forgotten it all and disregard and neglect what is recalled is evident everywhere these days in political, civil, and military discorse, but not any old discourse, it can now be traced down to a last tweet, so _every_ discourse. There is a bit of hyperreality at work here, as is the case every time with civilisational decline.


It is a generous award conferred by humanity upon civilisations is the tag itself. Without this _packaging_, there can be no wars, no debt-fuelled economic cycles, no joyrides on other people's money. But sooner or later, someone will make an unboxing video and then the conquest ends.


But what is civilisation if not war? Especially for the judeo-christian tradition. There have been civilisations out there which were never even discovered, or were never "unboxed" into mainstream historical narratives, but not this one. This one is its own string of wars, like Tony Blair is his own person. War is by and large christian fantasy, sans the religion, it is only a fantasy that goes around from one Jersualem to the next.


It is a cul-de-sac, either memeify yourself and move from ghetto to ghetto like the Jew, or turn around and let history repeat itself. Jimmy isn't good at trade-offs. In other words, the choice might resemble a political stalemate wherein the only winning move is self-sacrifice. 


There is good reason to be vary of stalemates for the absence of compromise enflames the wings of war and ignites "animal insticts" and eggs on tribal behaviour, dance of the vanities, irrational exuberances and other expression of power imbalance.


If you add to this exposive mixture the default narcissism of the average american, and you get a dance macabre in a burning room.
