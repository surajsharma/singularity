For a man driven to cast stones from within a glass house, One should not question the truth of the moon landing, but post-truth has made conspiracy theorists out of us all. Now everyone is a lobby unto themselves, everyone an advertiser, publisher and so on. Driving consensus from day to day is now deferred to data where reason still holds and to "any means necessary" where it doesn't.


Jimmy's essence is a peeping tom, a mind that leaps across boundaries man-made and otherwise, hence the clearly visible (but not for long) parallax because it is difficult to betray your true nature towards the end. Everyone in the village knows this, about the loose brick in the collapsing barn wall, but they're terrified of jimmy as he is a psycho.  One wanted to call this book "faggot nation" but better senses prevailed. Euphemisisms and scruples is perhaps how one lived or rather survived. Psychiatrists are in agreement about the impossibility of any treatment, whereas they would not bat an eyelid before administering electroconvulsive therapy to anyone who so much as steps out of line. 


In the abject poverty of science, sorry "STEM", lurk the currents and countercurrents of randomness but these people seem insulated inside a jelly bean looking at the world from whichever color's jelly covers their vision. In truth, there is no such thing as true randomness of the sky falling, everything is gradual, procedural, emergent, unrolling from the edge of history downstream to the teeming millions. The reality is that the oligarchy that has come to stand in lieu of the so called constitution is a very centralised and chaotic, especially vis-a-vis similar superstructures like the CCP, which makes our guys look like a mexican cartel at best.


But why do I write about the loser? Perhaps only a loser is worth writing about, perhaps a teary-eyed sendoff is earned. More certainly however, I write about a loser because I'm playing one. To an extent my manifesto was that of the underachiever's, but their actions begged for a criticism, if not (the final) judgement.


Jimmy ails from more mental disease per capita than any other country, as someone on reddit said, "put gun in bag, then go to school". One wonders, what purpose does sitting alone in a barn, armed to the teeth mumbling inanities in tongues on a moonless night serve? Jimmy has lost the plot, and more thoroghly than rome, more evenly across the board than perhaps the IVC.


But if that was just the case, one would have relaxed and sipped a mojito except the matrix is far more involved like when Rammstein sang "we're all living in america", and one was filled with so much hate one could write this entirely in song lyrics or epithtets as if an extension of solomon's song.


If evolving backwards was a sport, Jimmy would win olympic gold. The only place a peeping tom would never look is within, that kind of soul-searching is too new age for jimmy, just give him a pill. Indeed, why would you look within if all you ever known yourself to be is a peeping tom on oxycontin? "To thine own self be true" requires a handle on truth and self, two structures marked only by absense in jimmy's psyche calling into question the very identity he purports for in the lack of self, nothing is determined. America is deconstruction, and what better definition of deconstruction can there be if not deep sleep? such that if Rammstein had instead sung "we're all fast asleep", it would have meant the same thing. 


Sleep is thin veil from the burning truth which like the sun will come through if only to be slipstreamed-in from under the door, but there are ways around the sun in jimmy's plans.
