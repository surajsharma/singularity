In the absence of all science, mathematics is a joke that starts and ends in infinity, but this is only because man isnt fully machine yet. Forever is simply the current cycle in the locality of machinery. Gone are the days when the search of anything "unifying" was the holy grail, these days we only trace the contours of broken lineage of time running along buses on their circuits, this is symptomatic of a lack of differentiation between parts and the whole, a pattern of seeking that delivers only to sodom and gomorrah and indeed their women have begun twerking on the devil and while in the absence of all science religion rushes in to fill the vaccum, not all can wield their faith sincerely, fewer still skillfully, fewer still gracefully, which is to say non-violenty.

Such halo effects present themselves as dialectical paradoxes on the flip side, drama ensues and to the extent drama is myth, it lingers, oftentimes with foreboding.


As the last man out of saigon shall attest, nobody is truly irredeemable except time - at least that is one understanding of "all men" being created equal. but in dramas they like to act as if they were - which is woefully feminine.


There's a time and place to be insecure, but not everyone can pull terrorists and WMDs out of thin air. 


That's just where the bad news begins, not the political promise of _pax syrianna_ but the real prediction of the end. We were now dealing with a nation state that had "not" as its collective slogan but not what? crickets. self-cancellation was the bug.


The jostle was on, another great game as about to begin as the nations began to rush into the political gaps - did they really assume jimmy wouldn't try nukes again? there was some security in the fact that he wouldn't hasten his own demise. but in the shuffling of nervous feet the story was entirely different.


The average american intelligence spread across the globe but always amongst the lowest common denominator of society. Upper classes universally were critical and only NATO sponsored street urchins shouted of it being numero uno. Which makes sense as anti-intellectualism is still the norm coloring the society further matrilineal, shallow, cerebrally dense to the point of a natural palsy. it is one thing to have perversions, but totally another to worship the body obeying its whims to the point of chopping of one's limbs to satiate what is essentialy unsatiable.


Their paradox was not about the classic shakespearean _to be or not to be_ but rather _how_ not to be, and the only two options on the plate were lablled woke and wahabi. but why?


All empires end in prisons of their own making and in the case f the american mind, its bicamerality itself had somehow turned hostile. That's how zombies are born as the last pandemic confirmed.


United yet ever so alone, torn over molehills and exhibiting traditional symptoms of national fatigue. More fractured in spirit than before, splintered and shell-shocked by the proximity of the rest of the world on account of technology, unable to afford illusions of granduer past.


As if the whole country had looked into Medusa's eyes and turned to stone, it was a stupendous sight one could not have imagined much less dreamt up.


Dinner was severed, the dish called woke was a further decent into the inanity of choice and the dogma of process, while that labelled wahabi was to be, ostensibly an old college try but one which would last no longer than a puppy's yelp as it got steamrolled into flatness. Different hoax for different folks.


To be sure the powers that be were never true to a single nation, to them its another word to create hype around, but all jingoism has its roots in ideology and what was crumbling was in fact the very ideological basis of nation state itself. In other words, sovereignty for sale, but at what cost?


Longevity was now a curse upon life for if the hedgemon comes to see he is outliving everyone else in an eternal swamp, he will become desperate to turn everything into a swamp. _drill baby drill!_ and all that jazz.


But Longevity is never the goal of empire, "your startup will fail" is the mantra. Empires need more than ideology, a base though upon which to spin the yarn. This is always a positive idea like resilience, "can do" attitudes, and as in the case of Fourierism, a kind of self-sufficiency. Seldom is the summit clearly visible from the base camp however, so it is understandable if one works within constraints, if not "shoot for the stars", this is the essence of woke logic.


Wahabis take it to an extereme in a manner which leaves them crashed at the landing site. A fundamental lack of balance that is the bane of millenial life and its quintessential precariousness informs their judgement.


It would be perhaps too simplistic to assume the average lifespan in years of any civilization, but a ballpark would be lethally close to the age of the original colonies. No data is needed to confirm this but a point totally devoid from the narrative propagated through the zeitgeist.


It is decidedly the case that what will outlive the structure and function here is an oligarchy. In that much the end resembles that of the USSR, however, these are after all, god's second favorite people so we can expect the unexpected and my entire reason to write this is to convince them if i havent already to take the longer, scenic way home, that sounds very French so probably not in Texas.


However I may not get exactly what I want here too because waiting is to them the same thing as "doing time".


It is exactly like a guy driving a chevy in a police chase yelling "i wouldn't get caught dead!", that old school defiance and irreverence is long gone, along with any other positive core, even enough to choose between woke and wahabi. The paradox of final choice.
