One definition of psychopathy is "a suffering sown", the diminishing returns of racisms throw something back out of the soil. The thrust of these essays has been a natural intransigence, an innate reactionary palsy that uniquely corrupts all matter in this clusterfuck nation.


In a relativism, blaming everyone is the same as blaming noone, "what is to be done" is to start by calling an ostrich an ostrich and then to not compare the pigeons with the ostriches. Both tasks insurmountable by the size of american grey matter.


Lust his mother and anger his father, it is no wonder Jimmy turns to mother in times of stress and turmoil, but more than that, his attempts at playing the father are only theatrical, Jimmy is flesh and flesh alone, the masculine agression utterly devoid in his obsessions which is overcompensated into empire, military industrial complexes etc. Jimmy has no father to protect him and his weak flesh is naturally insecure. That's why he builds the barn wall, then pokes a brick out of it as immediate regret follows.


Ask yourselves, why only Japan and not some other nation that got the worse end of Jimmy's wrath? Diameterically opposed to Jimmy, Japan is actualy able to successfully overcompensate for the lack of a father, or a dead father etc. This makes Jimmy envious because it was him that was supposed to be the BDFL. Japan is also better at doing "race", but that is another book altogether.


Jimmy was always insane, but back then the insanity and hustle gave him at least the illusion of power, these days his insanity grows by the second due to a hard powerlessness every empire faces towards the fag end. Symptoms of this insanity are well-known and need no reiteration here.


The thrust of the argument is not mythical, or symbolic although there are both mythical and symbolic reasons for the structure of empirical revolutions, and the identical pattern all civilizations born out of context follow.


Thus powerless, weakened empires need to vent and historical figures are born out of such strifes, but Jimmy's end is different in that never before in recorded history has the planet's institutional memory been so democratised that even a child can trace anyone's entire geneology if they so desired. This compounds Jimmy's misery because more often than not control structures rely on a fundamental lack of knowledge. The bliss of ignorance is the only affordance of the common man.


Originally, the idea was never to be a "europe by proxy" but that in-fact is exactly the end that has come to pass. But which europe? Not the europe of renaissance and reformation, but the europe of the dark ages, if not worse - where people celebrate twerking on the devil and change gender out of boredom. 


Fast running out of it's synthetic saving graces, the teflon coating has started to wear thin and increasingly the narrative sustaining the nation state is eroding before our eyes.


The powerlessness is exacerbated by the lack of a uniting narrative to the extent that once again the assertions of racial unity find expression in the discourse of everyday life. But with education, even the pigeon-holed interpretation of race of the western whites cannot bring a turnaround in the decline.


As the totally bald CEO of one of the bulge-bracket banks once confided in me, "my hair grew back!". Jimmy is so utterly fucked that a war is imminent, and as of this writing it is anyone's guess what the toll will be. What is certain is that like all wars, the bankers will play a central role in igniting the fire.


So the catfish nation goes to war, but against whom? The anti-NATO sentiment has reached the zenith in local history, even Israel was chided by the whole world for panicking recently and going on a killing spree in the sandbox. Across the world people are waking up to the death of the hedgemon and preparing for ceremony - which is expected to turn violent.


When bottom feeders go to war, they drag the entire food chain with them - and this case is no exception - the very idea of nuclear deterrance has been tossed out the window and primal instincts reign. Nuclear deterrance was a flimsy idea to begin with, given the history of the planet. Like giving a child a firecracker and then expect them not to burst it, goes without saying a nuclear winter is unavoidable, and whoever makes the first move wins.


"It's been a while", is the general sentiment conveyed to me on the streets, and the garden needs pruning is well-established. From boardrooms to parliaments, the situation is taut.


A lot of people wonder if a civil war is on the cards, and while the data would predict one if one were to analyse the situation historically, but for a civil strife to happen one needs at least a section of the populace to be brave and faithful, if not a single brave leader to lead a rebelling faction, but outside the courage needed to get skin inked, brevity and rebellion have more or less left the land.


The argument could be made that the country was never free or brave, hence the advertisement "home of the free, land of the brave". On the contrary, it was populated only by those sweepings of europe that heeded the call of the whore of babylon. Sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll _was_ was the manifest destiny in its entirety - and both the manifest and the destiny have been exhausted - leaving behind as husk that is an advertisement.


Jimmy is special only in that his judgement will be the easiest of all civilisations historically. A conscience-less, cerebrally-dense, book-hating, fate-testing people whose only hustle was packing and labelling - stuff, phenomenon, and people. Their undoing were people such as the author, phenomenon and stuff such as the internet, AI, and cryptocurrency - anything that naturally resists packaging and labelling. Although, the aforementionted trinity sufferred a pitiable end too - for whatever Jimmy cannot label or put in a box, Jimmy destroys.
