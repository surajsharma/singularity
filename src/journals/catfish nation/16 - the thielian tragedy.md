Of course Jimmy isn't _all_ bad. Nobody is beyond redemption, not even the last man out of Saigon represented these days by the spark that Peter Thiel once was. But the artist formerly known as Prince has long since had his shot and these days gets his kicks by being a mild annoyance to me.


What is a bit surprising is the stifling out of all flame, as if a lighter flicked backwards in time. Like a feminine judgement, which is rare to say the least. Much as he is personally revered around these woods, the powerlessness he represents is matched only by the tall claims he once made, that could in essence, stand the test of time for any lie one may conjure.


If everyone knows the moon landing was fake, and nobody brings it up in polite company, does that take away from the facade we feed off of? This in essence is the Thielian tragedy, the deception one uses as a political mask consumes the very face it hides.


The theater knows no company but misery. A droll lampooning of misfits, by misfits.
