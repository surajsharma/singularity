Of course Jimmy isn't _all_ bad. Nobody is beyond redemption, not even the last man out of Saigon represented these days by the spark that Peter Thiel once was. But the artist formerly known as Prince has long since had his shot and these days gets his kicks by being a mild annoyance to me.


What is a bit surprising is the stifling out of all flame, as if a lighter flicked backwards in time. Like a feminine judgement, which is rare to say the least. Much as he is personally revered around these woods, the powerlessness he represents is matched only by the tall claims he once made, that could in essence, stand the test of time for any lie one may conjure.


If everyone knows the moon landing was fake, and nobody brings it up in polite company, does that take away from the facade we feed off of? This in essence is the Thielian tragedy, the deception one uses as a political mask consumes the very face it hides.


The theater knows no company but misery. A droll lampooning of misfits, by misfits. In other words, bullshit proper.


It is difficult to write about the liminality that now sucks in from every direction all sorts of bush-league ideas and half-assed executions. Difficult because even politically, the lusture is lost, the zeal conquered, the satisfaction promised inherently in the "american dream" and the foolhardy penchant for the frontier (aka the american way) has all been delivered unto the diminishing returns of time. 


Into the resulting poticial and historical vacuum have rushed in all kinds of non-sequituers and dangerous ideas that feed off the chaos in the swamp. The absolute, knock-on-wood decree of a people asserting themselves against the next onslaught of fear, doubt, paranoia, the devil himself has all been dissolved into a heap of hopeless, powerless, paralysing jumble of everyday actions which have neither grounding in theory, nor are confirmed by any aspirational practice.


The sewer isn't leaking, its jammed and desperately needs to burst, if not at least leak into the surroundings. But just like Peter Theil, it will neither explode nor leak - therein lies the only extant justification of our times, the penultimate reason of the downfall and the ultimate tragedy.


Surely in his humility Thiel would downplay this angle, but end times are characterised by fatalist characters. The German determination that was supposedly absolute has, pardon the pun, petered out of the system. 


This is where things start to get cartoonish. Things are either overdetermined or undetermined to the point of chaos. Tarriffs, for example are one end of the spectrum, being a tax-on-tax, a "cowards's diplomacy", whereas on the other end, we have an economic system that stands only on a self-aggrandising, self-perpetuating vacuuous loop memeified.
