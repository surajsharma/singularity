"To thine own self be true" but what if thine own self is rotten? That indeed is the case, upon closer inspection not only the 1%, but even the 99% find little spark or joy within. The fact is not that all are rotten, but a wholly aristotlian/darwinian worldview is a more appropriate thread to follow back into history and pre-history to better identify the strain of thinking that has led the world here.


The misappropriation of material causes, first by parochial interests (tragedy), then by historical compulsions (farce) and the poor understanding of evolution can be considered the staple they have been brought up on without much questioning. Which makes sense since science and philosophy were never their strong suite. 


The good news is that what we are living through is definitely a farce, the bad news is that what follows farce is necessarily the tragedy of recognition. If we are to avert this tragedy, we must first stop trying to reason with darkness and second, extinguish it with light, but the masses have a goldfish memory and their suffering continues to power the three-legged empire destined to live in dog's years.


This idea is not originial by now, Putin understands this, as does Israel to an extent hence we get the latest tiffs and flashpoints such as Ukraine etc. However, the problem is so entrenched that mere symbolic war will not suffice, the tragedy to come will have to compensate for everything since 1945. Including these faux attempts at forgetting.


Tony Soprano called the coroner, I'm merely writing the post-mortem report. What remains is just a story that goes around the room and the people, including me, who profiteer from its telling and retelling, failing to fix things fully each time, until its time for the next hedgemon and the next troop that capitulates over itself - like an ouroboros.


On the embalmer's table lies a giant fish with lipstick on that has been fucked in every orifice more times than people have bathed in the Ganges. The guy who brought the cadaver in told me the her last words were "judgement scales". Inside the fish was a giant VHS tape full of west-coast pornography, Jason Bourne style. My job is to edit to make it seem like he "fixes the cable" because that will be remembered and not the fact that all three actors died of AIDS, in their own vomit in the bathtub.


To that extent, the sexual repression of puritanical europe that was directly responsible for populating the new world came full circle in the sleep and depravity that has come to define modern USA. This sleep and depravity are not some seasonal affective disorder that ends with september but the very constitutive fibre of the american being. Not that they were not having orgies in Rome 1.0, but those orgies were way more fun for obvious reasons. Modern American comes out of an orgy more dissastisfied than she was going in.


Just ask Jimmy, who is getting more perplexed as the twilight skinny-dips into the night. To thine own self be true, but what if thine own self is a fish with a porn VHS inside it? As far as metaphors go, there couldn't be a more apt description of the dead american spirit, in the bathtub of the internet, soaking in its own LLM-induced vomit. Inference? more like interference into healthy brain functioning.
