> _And as every present state of a simple substance is naturally a consequence of its preceding state, so its present is pregnant with its future._ - Gottfried Leibniz, Monadology


#### 4.1 We leave nothing to chance for randomness is a slice of entropy, the very definition of the word "random" implies that any cognitive artifact can be placed in a context however relative, giving everything a proper place in eternal return. 

4.1.2 that which isn't rational isn't real. it might be imaginary, symbolic, or even transcendental, but rationality is the domain of reason alone and randomness is irrational apriori.

#### 4.2 The absolute interconnectivity described previously implies that each machine runs deterministically, in an inifinitely linear chain of state transmission.

4.2.1 a machine is never in a "random" or free state, though it may be a stateless


#### 4.3 states are broadly contained in two definitions, those of desiring production and biophysical production.
