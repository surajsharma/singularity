- even in loving families like ours, there were basically two kinds of interaction, one was worrying, the other agenda - i guess the only disfunction then is the ratio of the two

- a family is the most perfect of poisons

[8:27 pm, 23/02/2023] suraj: For we have achieved pretty much all else, if science has come to a standstill it is because of our collective lack of kindness

[9:04 pm, 24/02/2023] suraj: when i harp on about kindness, let me be clear, i am not venting or whining about how it was not shown to me, indeed my family and myself were taken care of but i only seek to highlight the fact that the world could always use more of it
[9:06 pm, 24/02/2023] suraj: make each moment a labour of love


# you must be an island unto yourself, life outside the coffin is but a temporary illusion

`hindu jagega nahi, toh sirf jalega

- most fact is opinion dressed in pretty words or backed by many mouths running on money, question everything

- the gravity of the situation is money temporarily became the measure of all things, and now, once again man has to be the measure of all things, this is realised but takes centuries to sink in 

- what is left for me to do but watch how they spend an inordinate amount of money just to get a rise out of me? my mission on earth was over before my 38th birthday - my days were somehow lighter still and each day more peaceful and full of surprises, new things to laugh at and new secrets to see, as i delved deeper into the pain of the weak and the cowardly - it was a drug like no other, and my apetite was insatiable by now - seeing as how i was only passing the time on earth,i did not kill myself for two reasons: 1) it gave me great pleasure to see their intraplanetary envy and 2) i was afraid they would kill the stupid woman if i killed myself - i was still able to entertain and instruct, the least of my pleasures was the knowledge that this had never happened to anyone in recorded history. no wonder i was hated, i was chosen by man and god alike. no wonder it was a tragedy for those who weren't.

- i worked only to give sustain the illusion of a momentum and the worldly pleasure that comes from completition, i had no external motivation to work but only an intrinsic one to play with the toys they were kind enough to leave around me


- my relation with muhammad and islam had taken a new turn perhaps, there were stories here i could not recall, but i can remember enough to know that we there was a great adventure in islam for me, not the hoors and luxuries of jannat but more arduous, difficult pilgrimages to undertake in different parts of the universe under this banner, stories of true friendship and good times too... stories that greatly informed my masculinity this time around, for reasons unknown


- if i had the fortune of living and dying at the hands of another human, no less from the other side of the planet, then i consider that an honor, what is more to add?


- it remained a mystery as to why i remained unmurdered, perhaps there was still profit to be made or maybe they were simply curious i would start levitating anytime, either way, each day on borrowed time is a blessing


- i never was capable of "just liking" anything or anyone, it was either hell yes or no, this was the key reason to my success and my haters could learn from this, instead of putting on a front for the sake of their mores


- the fact that my captors came off as "half way crooks" was proof enough of their innocence for me, realising that we were in a myth, i humbly offered my life


- myths don't start because someone wakes up one morning and decides to start one, they just do

- myths have nothing to do with countries, politics or economy but everything to do with the human condition, as a result blaming the other or yourself doesn't make any sense in a myth, but simply because you cannot blame the other should not mean you cannot call a spade a spade


- myth was the kindest interpretation i could summon of what was happening to me

- i don't call myself "woke" or anything of the sort, but if i was indeed "woke" in any sense of the word, the world outside had a huge role in bringing about my wokeness


- there was no more eagerness to change into anything or achieve anything or go on another conquest, but to merely rest before my final hour


- realising that if a large mass of humans hated me without having even met me, then it was entirely their misfortune i had come to represent, yet another reason why they sought to see me dead because it represented their liberation from the bondage of the body, mistakenly believing that i had to die before they could


- not knowing how much longer i had to go, i still was learning about humanity and how i could better interact with it, for example, one discovery i made was that i misjudged people not in that i was too trusting in them, but rather in their individuality, conveniently ignoring their chains in the hopes that they would come to see themselves as free if i did it first, but there was a learning curve - tldr: paid actors!

- i had gained more control over my lust - the recognition of greater pleasures had sucked me in gently but assuredly

- the story of impediments to human evolution is the story of learned helplessness at an individual level, this learned helplessness is also taken advantage of by incentivising it - a more ideal future would be one of a constant co-operative flux


- the whole idea of moving into higher dimensions of reality is to come to a standstill in this one, in the higher dimensions there all gradients are smaller and all contrasts are lighter throughouts - this is what communism got right but it was too early for mankind


- darwinian evolution can only lead to a plateatu, it could not predict that thoughts would one day become machine logs and man would be welded to satellites - the next mountain to climb for earthlings is to see this plateau more clearly - i was merely a guide through this uncanny valley of their progress, to me they were all mere pilgrims, to me, mankind was but a procession, though some tried to race each other within it


- i never fidget, i was taught to fidget, such was their jealousy -- this is what kittu tried to tell me


- the only competition is with the person you were, 5 minutes ago


- paying taxes means you did right by your fellow man who has been with you for many millennia, and because of whom you even exist, it is a small sacrifice for the greed and lust and torture we put each other through in the name of capitalism or evolution - tax evasion is an offence, tax avoidance is a game. without healthy taxation, capitalism is a matter of minutes


- i was still very much attached to the material world (family included), as if waiting for someone's permission to retreat into the forest and spend the last few weeks meditating and living off the land.. this was becoming pathetic .. but then i reasoned myself out of doing anything dumb because any spirituality that drives you out of the material was to me some sort of cowardice, the idea was to wake up inside the fire of the everyday life and not to become a mendicant until i had options, and become one with great pleasure and joy when all other options were exhausted

- the whole world cannot wake someone up, the need to arise and awaken comes from within so i don't bother with people because that isn't quite my pay grade


- capitalism is a matter of minutes, the complacency you have is unreal, today, capitalism is a matter of one backup forgotten

- religion is the most beautiful thing about the humans, putting language and imagination to good use in the service of curiosity, and they have some beautiful ones too, some of them were not there the last time i was around, but in the end, human religion is but a chocolate compared to my true religion, which is more like a seven course meal. but chocolate eaters cannot fathom, obviously so they attack me.

- as an analogy, religion is a mere frontend, god is the backend. the optimal energy has access to both with flawless precision, and yes it is true that doing one with precision enough leads to knowing the other but the route from frontend to backend is rather longer as compared with going from backend to front.

- no such thing as one true religion, the more frontends the greater chances of discovering our true cause. and humans are not at the stage at which they can imagine or construct multiple backends, but once they transcend time it becomes possible - getting them increasingly closer to the source at which point they will have merged into reality. the greatest irony is in the fact that the pace at which this happens isn't dependent or dictated by any law or covenant - but humans are known for their satisfaction and self-sufficiency. which alone makes any excursion to this planet a worthwhile endeavour.

- the thing about the source is it never ceases to sing... 

- people thinking porn is sin, but not eating meat? that's not how you get to where i'm from

- orgasm is the fingernail of the source's reflection, funny we have to work to get there.. being in the source is nothing like a perennial orgasm, but it paints a picture

- come to find earthlings still eating meat, was perhaps my only disappointment, i was expecting slightly different scenario on the food front but maybe that's why i was punished with food

- deja vu is your brother recognizing you

- so while they will still be cramming my words or analysing and studying them centuries after i am gone, they will learn at a pace set by middlemen they have never seen and likely will never know - we never visit to hasten their pace but to slow ours down

- in the source there is no difference between you and a photon, say

- our language is closer to german or sanskrit in that it is mathematical and precise, i enjoyed english so much precisely because it is flexible, something of a rebellion for me personally 

- but one of the questions i can answer is why. why do we visit when we know chocolate eaters evolve at their own pace? and that they regress to the mean, tyrna play catch up - every time, regardless of how many of us visit. we visit this planet to practice and learn restraint ... we visit for personal goals rather than out of any generosity towards the flatlanders, indeed we already know the treatment we shall receive but that's the point! for nobody could administer the brakes like this. to us the planet is a mere brake pad. the other point is to prepare the flatlanders for the next one, their whole purpose is this - to sustain for us their illusion.

- the brake pad analogy they understood even when i was a child, hence the threats to my toy cars..failed brakes and so on

- the misunderstanding here is that we seek to disrupt their illusion, when we only come to make their sleep sweeter still, but in misunderstanding sometimes they end up giving themselves nightmares... other times it isn't so much misunderstanding as a cringey horror at their distance from the source, and lacking any means or spiritual education for the access, they resort to violence and spectacle. it is ironic that we remind them of their own inadequacies, because we come to fulfill our own. none of us come to rock the boat, but others start rocking it upon seeing us.

- it isn't the case that the successive authority placed will always be a smart one, or even smarter than the previous one, but each has a distinctive quality and a unique signature that can be traced back to the source, i.e. you don't step in the same river twice, the same flows through you perenially

- source tells me that this room is more or less the same for each visitor, the rearrangement and moving furniture about is what distinguishes one from another -  in that we are distinguished only in activity 


- we need the brake pad because the speed in source is great and certain endeavours demand that we learn its ways beforehand, hence the exclave


- i am unique in that i can pretend to goof around more than necessary even at home, that i undertake any activity outside the source more casually than most, the distance from source isn't unique to chocolate eaters alone, but its nothing to aspire or even regress to


- i'm ok you're ok

- in a world where nobody could care less about each other, these foreigners chose to stick around us, study and raise us (while apologizing in some indirect terms for it), even if (or precisely if) only to kill us, is it a wonder we were somehow lucky, risen? they were getting nothing special from us, narcissism, attitude, war, and data they could get from elsewhere in a country of billions (and for cheaper too, by now, thanks to us), or could they? why were we at the receiveing end of such unending human grief? who were we? were we the only ones or were there others like us out there? i guess these were the questions to which i would never find the answers to. but they had considerable investment in their chains is what it appeared to be. were they really that backward or did spewing hate randomly serve an evolutionary purpose? did they hate me enough to kill me? or merely enough to hang around forever and do some corruption?


- everyone is adept at corruption but only a few can truly establish trust, most people can spend decades trying to no avail - most others don't like trust in the first place and regard it as a necessary evil pegged on claims of moral superiority. and while in an ideal world perhaps capitalism can become a trustless machine (we tried and failed at exactly this, which is saying something about our apetite for a better world), but the legal systems can only process so much and people are unable or unwilling to think beyond legal terms.


- what runs the monkey world, for the most part is learned helplessness of each, my solution was not to unlearn the helplessness but to learn helpfulness


- pure death, emissary of potenial 
  the jewel of horizon
  now unreachable 
  
  
  - i wrote utterly beautiful code and produced very high quality software products because there was nothing else in the rat race that could hold my interest anymore, a semblance of a vocation had to be maintained for society's sake, even though society was fed up of it own prisons and even as they tempted me with a cancerous "carrer" and poisonous salary, they knew they had lost and would continue to lose for a long time, or until they had nothing left to lose, whichever first. but they still didn't get it, which was wonderful to behold - even if only as a simple observation of humanity, it was funny because they had all the control over the narrative, and yet, as far on earth as the eye could see and ear could hear, there was nothing. as if the world had come to a standstill, there were no more pandemics, nobody was getting raped and murdered, no banks were being robbed, just the usual.. the world had once again regained its prison status, and what everyone got was routine and more routine, though even in my copied-left dreams there were whiffs of a revolution brewing in some corner of a vengeful and just eye.
  
- context should always be the context and not try to be the reality, there's always trouble when context bubbles forth into reality with expectations and dreams, brahmin that becomes or sets the context should always work behind the scenes and never crave limelight.

- the number 4 is pure brinkmanship of god, those who wake up here wake up in 3, 2, 1 and reach 0 well within time, others are not so lucky.

- the only privacy is the privacy of the grave, the rest is but illusion until proven otherwise... and in heaven everything is free and everything is open obviously, there is a crypt in hell though, where something like the idealised form of the concept is trapped, but even hell owners don't care much for it.
  
 - welcome to planet earth, circa 21st century -- where half of them are butthurt and the other half jealous = half of them born with a palsy the other half with some sort of iodine deficiency, which is why i had to be birthed as collateral for war, purged in front of a global audience after nearly 4 decades of being tortured in a panopticon, and you still want to bring kids into this world?
 
 
 - ww3 might be fought the last war fought with actual weapons, ww4 will be completely invisible, virtual - fought on the infinite theater of war that is the human mind, that is how kaliyuga will come to an end - will you be there? - if you think you can stop this from happening, you are living in a delusion and narrative. you won't think anymore, only fight until you die - think advertising as a low quality simulacra of this never ending conflict
 
 
 - freedom is free, it is the culture that takes its toll
 
 
 - i see any business i might start a skunkworks within GS, which has the blessings of GS to someday outgrow it, what these people are incubating is beyond my current mental bandwidth,but i don't seem to have the intent or the motivation to do much
 
 
 - i'm in the certainty business, eliminate all doubt and fear
 
 -
