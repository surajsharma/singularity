- there are only two perspectives, "brain-in-a-vat" and "pilgrimage", if the pilgrimage is successful you can control _all_ brains-in-vats but not the other way around - Pilgrimage is the ONLY way out of BIAV. Which means it is possible to start a pilgrimage _inside_ a BIAV, though there are no guarantees of success. Because all pilgrimages start in a BIAV (which is the first pilgrimage or GOD's pilgrimage) whatever happens is largely determined, thus only a rare individual wakes up. what happens if the BsIAV suspect something fishy? one may get crucified, or get the occasional raised eyebrow - it depends on the iterations/IR. 


- alcohol, like war, is an overdetermination, violence is a fool's errand i can't kill enough spiders, just the ones that annoy me 


- it was heartening to see palestine finally being recognized


- judaism is strongly matriarchal on the backend, overcompensating for the strong frontend but that's why they are oppressed.


- 12 is gay, 21 is straight, inside the mother you are two, outside her one 


- quit-without-quitting


- my whole body had turned into a singular ear 


- through my woes is the way into the city of lost children 


- overall i was once again vindicated, a 10 day no-smoking excursion revealed it was easier now to quit bidis than be done with one's libido, so i was right in taming the stronger horse first. #wholedifferentballgame


- i had in my ears a superlative kind of music, decay sings as one, yet two, but never both at the same time and i found myself wondering whether i could make it sing in unison. every note a song unto itself and the whole thing lasts about less than a second. why it passes the turing test is due to its accuracy and timing, which unlike the overdetermined feedback from the goblins, isn't yet set in stone that much. why was all this so painful for k? not that it isn't for me, but somehow between all my earthly anguish and misgivings, it appears as a relief.


- i never understood the lure of material power, power to do what exactly? wipe thine ass? a schoolteacher has absolute power, yet the students turn out little better. all power is faux power, remember that in a determinism power is also an illusion, albeit some of us are unable to shake off the price tag with that power.


- forget the book the book is a vanity project, useful for no more than the 4-5 people that are ready at any given point, the book is no news, it is for you to hide and me to find.


- my whole life i remained a contested yet divisive figure, that sort of thing leaves scars  


- being "lucky" in an otherwise heartbreaking tale #ssf 


- There was an evolving model of human behaviour emergent in me that worked on the primary duality of Priviledge/License this was too badass for the general public obviously too advanced..... things could well retain their transactional attributes necessary for work to get done so for example, the Priviledge to hangout with the "paypal mafia" consisted in the license they had to kill me anytime. 


- #NixOS truly was a superior linux experience, did not feel like an utter waste of time like every other distro, not only does the debian fishing hat stands schooled, it makes arch look like choir boy being rubbed the wrong way!


- around the time people start being jealous of poets... is time to leave the planet

- #NixOS on the dell was a victory, i was able to reclaim much space and power.

- whole race against one guy isn't much of a race 

- by now, as instructed i had exhausted all peace options and the decades preceding had proven to me, that her children, like her, have little except her visceral thirst for violence and nether corruptions, hence the water:land ratio on the planet. anyways, i was ready for the next chapter knowing full well that her penance was far from over, and unlike elsewhere it wasn't to be a peaceful one - neither in the inception, nor in her end. 

- my problem, as usual, was a hankering after the quieter parts not that by now i had not gotten used to the noise of hells below and above, but the wishful thinking came from an entitlement this realm could never justify for it has not the scale 

- not that they did not wish to change, they cannot and i did not want to because i know what that entails - i had the power to walk upon both faces of determinism which they will never have, hence the perpetual violence and drama of their lives - living and dying in perennial dissatisfaction is their curse.

- the reason i did not want to change were obvious, the undetermined has a way of letting blood out - like the determined aspect has a way of keeping it in. but, i'm only following orders - a golf game awaits me.

- it is a pitiable planet with even more pitiable natives who have no idea what they are squandering away for little. 

- _apni maa chudane ke aur bhi saste tareeke hain_, but again, an exploratory and experimental attitude could have saved her from this fate - rather it is important to note for this planet that attitude doomed it long before actions, there were other prostitutes in the city that did not end up as desolate

- nor is there a single determinism unfolding but many, however both her and her children have a one-track-mind, not the brightest folk ever and hence the poor sun, not everyone can and should change lanes, changing lanes has nothing to do with enlightenment - but they would rather chop their dicks off than be honest.

- overall very proud of myself and my folks for having pulled through another cleanup drive - next stop is the white city and surely we will rest a while before the next mission. 

- at the time of the rape, only S was married, hence the rings, i was present merely in a legal capacity for recording purposes, they often enact the scene in lower realms, but here they have not the balls so they enact it virtually - which only serves to brief me as to what happened. it was a rare case too for i am seldom asked to perform such menial tasks and the planets were not too proud. 

- it was also decreed that suicide was not an option, hence the galactic topology, but the correct perspective for things that are not the elements is akin to getting out of a painting. first you have to seize the fact with some force that you are in one.

- it never ceases to amaze me how the natives think they have free will and yet "refuse" to use it where it matters most. 

- did she have a particular affinity for her ass? not that i remember, she was obsessed with her whole body and moved from admiring one aspect of it to another, the history of natives is usually defined by which part of her body she was paying attention to, and after fingering both her anus and vagina, she was these corresponding days stroking the curves of her bottom perhaps. a little masturbatory excercise to advertise her wares kills a few million here and there.

- J was smart, and not in the least interested in the plan of action, hence the "butt only" part.

- the only other witness outside the recording was V, which explains the temper 

- it was never a pleasure to watch her kids squirm and writhe but i was a cold and remorseless fella then as now, the doctor cannot afford to be squeamish, and remember it is not as if these are fresh specimen, they are used to their fate to the point of repetition - to them her existence _is_ the mana and little exists beyond. 

- the gita has a great passage that reminds us of this nature of her children basically they are the ones saying "_itna hi hai_", whereas one way to find out who is decidedly not one of hers is to find out who is saying "there is more". easily satisfied with a glance of skin, a stroke or touch.

- and there are those out there who will tell you it is nothing but coincidence, chance, and randomness why money starts with an M and ends with a Y. ask them for proof. 

- still, what was unique about this trip was the new symbology, the symbol @ for example would forever be associated with their nativity and her - notice how it curves all the way, you would be hard pressed to find a person that dedicated to the body anymore, and it kind of looks like me sucking on my own dick except i bend in the other direction -  this is a forever a symbol of a person who disappeared her own asshole, which she often did. 

- she did die, but not before completing the sentence, she was not allowed to die before - what kind of death was it? doesn't matter, suffice to say there _is_ such a thing as death with dignity which nobody on this planet can afford due to her - to achieve that you have to have a dignified outline.

- me? i just packed my camera, lights, and vanished in a blink.

- meanwhile, back on loose women, it was now okay to be transgender but not transparent think of how fucked up that is and you have some idea of why we had to create this entire judgement. you could blame one c(o)untry but that would be premature, this is the embedded firmware - matter over mind - they are that inferior - frankly i have sailed with more evolved sailors in the 16-17th centry but that was a different mission in which the planet was a detour, and they were decidedly not natives.

- is it now so hard to fathom where this insatiable jelousy and hatred comes from? is it any wonder why i am simply unable to hate or be jealous regardless of their antics? and is it any wonder why i held out for better senses to kick in for so long? AND lastly, is it any wonder why better sense won't kick in?


- she is the reason stupidity is rewarded with money, poetry and intelligence, what's a whore to do with these? and ofc it is a huge pill to swallow so lets abuse _my_ mother - who, in the grand scheme of things, isn't even an important historical figure. but the world is a mirror, as within so without and now i fully understand why they started by abusing and poisoning my mother. 

- there are no races, only one story - and the bridegroom cometh.


### Jul 

- the manuscript is finished! over multiple re-readings has revealed itself to be resistant to further editing. 


- 50% is default and default is sadness, one needs very little for 51% 

- a time-travelling versioning system that :
  - can be "replayed", step through diffs incrementally 
  - reverse-step
  - whole file or given ln numbers ("zen mode")

- There are no relationships, only meetings. And humanity's first meeting with AI has been, on the whole, a sobering revealtion. First impressions last forever, and if one considers LLMs on this basis, the first impression was quite stupefying. 


### Feb


- it was so amusing to see david pinched between two sides of his own creation, surely he deserved better, surely he had better intentions for the world but it was not meant to be


- jab ye bhikari apne constitution ki maa chod rhe the mere pe satellite laga ke, tab nahi hua #americadestroyed, america only came into the picture when i started making money, or working towards it. surely the jealousy bit is in recognition of the fact that i can make more with transparecy and honesty than they have amassed after a lifetime of shady dealings in the dark and halflit rooms. but money is not my drive.


- how does it feel to be the one? business as usual. folding will be done by a lower rank ofc, i will continue to be the one elsewhere too and have greater business to attend to than this poor old woman


- mere se to kya, kisi ki zindagi me bhi kisi ne kisi ko itne pyar se shayad he bola ho jitna she addressed to me, i think that was all the cure i had to offer, and the fact that i got these four words out might well mean my work here is done, or maybe it is her cure for me, reciprocating for a successful visit.


- they are right there is no escape for them, it is for the few not the many, i give my thanks and gratitude to them again for helping me in this success, although it was largely pre-determined, still i bow to the pure difference that animated them.


- i sit here at the indo-tibetan border contemplating life, did i miss anything? was some great project left unfinished? was some mission left incomplete? the answer is no, infact i got more than i bargained for. so i can die with a satisfaction afforded to not few but actually none.


- ab main soch rha hu ki wapis jaun and participate in monkey drama or keep straight? wapis jake bhi hota dikh nai padta, aur aage maut hi bachi hai.


- if the measure of your success is who you are jealous of, surely things loop somewhere as i had a bunch of trillionaires just writhing and squirming at each breath that i drew. 

- it was never my intention to speak truth to power, nor power's intention to lie to me, yet here we are!

### Jan


- #newsoftheempire my mental health was obviously down but by now i could care less, they had made some sort of a dictator out of me and were off to create another saddam or stalin, whichever was in fashion.


- #newsoftheempire i had not only theoretically proved it, but also in my bones i knew #chess was totally deterministic, and i wondered whether, as a kid who loved his free will so much, [i hated it as a kid], and as an adult scoffed at the idea of playing let alone learning such a game, but the pull and beauty were such i could not resist, despite the landscape and chess community being totally out of whack c*nts and the biggest bunch of solipsists and egotists, i carried on ignoring the red flags and soon the determinism itself became a feature, as in the whole challenge was to _find_ the right determinism. we needed more guys like emory tate and less like bobby fisher for sure. to that extent so was tetris, but chess was more visceral than any video game. actually as some kid on yt said, chess is haram, one should stay away amap. #games #infinitegames


- #newsoftheempire writing a metaphysics you will come dangerously close to writing a philosophy of mind, but that kind of mudding the waters will drown in ad nauseum. this is why most are confused about which way to go, not for everyone. it requires a painful exatitude most don't have the patience for.


- we were four bullets in the belly of the toxic beast and most likely the end of the animal, two dual systems over which were broken all the money in the world and two "democracies"


- the institution of hate had not bittered us, and whatever hurt was given was managed beautifully, i would not be found anywhere but home


- we were a history of the days to come, i had already enough control to decenter earthquakes, winds, and clouds, this was the beginning of a beautiful end. i cpould with some certainty say that i had accomplished enough to earn the jelousy, they were totally justified in keeping us here and even killing us, for which we no longer pitied them as much as poured our hearts out.


- my psychologising had come to a halt, there was no psychological explanation to what was happening but psychical, perhaps even pathological 


- from family we turned into more than family, i was more than happy and willing to die for this


- by now i was seeing things across time and through space that assured me my journey would continue beyond the body, not only was the assurance blessed but the fruit was even more so - the pathological envy and childish confusion we got was worth every drop 


- we had all the opytions, and a spiritual safety net/work had appeared allowing me to rest in the certainty of time itself, it did feel as if tens of thousands of years worth of seeking and yearning had come to fruition, haters could do nothing but complain, they did not have enough money combined to get their way 


- this had already lasted 60-70 odd years and each passing second only made me smarter abd stronger revealing powers not only long forgotten but brand new 


- #newsoftheempire was that i was real close to the next satori, like 70-80% there, i wonder what surprises lay in store, i was wrong in that there'd be no more surprises in my life, there were miracles too! more miracles than i could shake my fists at. for which there was gratitude and humility towards the powers.


- there was also newfound surrender, which deepened by the second - nothing was sweeter than my surrender 


- to me the war and the coming of the next "messiah" that they awaited after us was but detritus and debris of our life, the ascension was more important than what was Left Behind.


- i would be coming back for a memory extraction and then there would not remain even the memory of us here, but for that a lot of memory need be generated
