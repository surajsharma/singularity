### January

- show me one guy to listen to who is not an indian and i wil show you a charlatan, an entertainer out to make a quick buck, or a 1% illuminati member

- for the last time, there is no war (as far as i can see, and i can see the end and beyond that from here), only narcissistic entertainment and politics, please ya'll are so tiresome

- very high quality narcissistic entertainment because i am not coming back, you are, and for this you might act in self-destructive ways which worries me

- the world will always appear as if in a pact to blow up anytime, this is an illusion

- if i am unable to raise others to my level, i am sure as shit not falling to theirs

- in situations of moral dissonance, we should do the most im/moral thing we possibly can. i.e revert to extremes, because any situation that creates a moral dissonance in you is likely an evil, objectively narcissistic double-bind undeserving of moderate response. the only fitting response in such a situation is a violently disproportinate one.
