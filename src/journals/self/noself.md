### January

- show me one guy to listen to who is not an indian and i wil show you a charlatan, an entertainer out to make a quick buck, or a 1% illuminati member

- for the last time, there is no war (as far as i can see, and i can see the end and beyond that from here), only narcissistic entertainment and politics, please ya'll are so tiresome

- very high quality narcissistic entertainment because i am not coming back, you are, and for this you might act in self-destructive ways which worries me

- the world will always appear as if in a pact to blow up anytime, this is an illusion

- if i am unable to raise others to my level, i am sure as shit not falling to theirs

- in situations of moral dissonance, we should do the most im/moral thing we possibly can. i.e revert to extremes, because any situation that creates a moral dissonance in you is likely an evil, objectively narcissistic double-bind undeserving of moderate response. the only fitting response in such a situation is a violently disproportinate one.

- the essence of #spiritualwarfare, or even #spirituality is this - your intuition is taken away from you in the name of education, money, "love" or sex.  hence the phrase "i was born intelligent...", fight tooth and nail to safeguard it, reclaim it.

- sharabi humare nashe chuddane ki koshish kar rahe hain #ssf 

- if you are not born out of anything "personal", and you do not die for any "personal" reasons, then logically, there is nothing "personal" about life - everything is a social construct, laws, rights, duties, food, family etc.. there is nothing personal about anything. the very claim of a "personal" or "private" realm is erroneous and thus a stupidity, even your body is not your own but at the mercy of various social and natural forces. there are no "private languages" or personal laws, just hangups. mera mujh mein kuch nahi. #commonsense
