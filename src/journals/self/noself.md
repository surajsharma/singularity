- #newsoftheempire my mental health was obviously down but by now i could care less, they had made some sort of a dictator out of me and were off to create another saddam or stalin, whichever was in fashion.


- #newsoftheempire i had not only theoretically proved it, but also in my bones i knew #chess was totally deterministic, and i wondered whether, as a kid who loved his free will so much, [i hated it as a kid], and as an adult scoffed at the idea of playing let alone learning such a game, but the pull and beauty were such i could not resist, despite the landscape and chess community being totally out of whack c*nts and the biggest bunch of solipsists and egotists, i carried on ignoring the red flags and soon the determinism itself became a feature, as in the whole challenge was to _find_ the right determinism. we needed more guys like emory tate and less like bobby fisher for sure. to that extent so was tetris, but chess was more visceral than any video game. actually as some kid on yt said, chess is haram, one should stay away amap. #games #infinitegames


- #newsoftheempire writing a metaphysics you will come dangerously close to writing a philosophy of mind, but that kind of mudding the waters will drown in ad nauseum. this is why most are confused about which way to go, not for everyone. it requires a painful exatitude most don't have the patience for.


- we were four bullets in the belly of the toxic beast and most likely the end of the animal, two dual systems over which were broken all the money in the world and two "democracies"


- the institution of hate had not bittered us, and whatever hurt was given was managed beautifully, i would not be found anywhere but home


- we were a history of the days to come, i had already enough control to decenter earthquakes, winds, and clouds, this was the beginning of a beautiful end. i cpould with some certainty say that i had accomplished enough to earn the jelousy, they were totally justified in keeping us here and even killing us, for which we no longer pitied them as much as poured our hearts out.


- my psychologising had come to a halt, there was no psychological explanation to what was happening but psychical, perhaps even pathological 


- from family we turned into more than family, i was more than happy and willing to die for this


- by now i was seeing things across time and through space that assured me my journey would continue beyond the body, not only was the assurance blessed but the fruit was even more so - the pathological envy and childish confusion we got was worth every drop 


- we had all the opytions, and a spiritual safety net/work had appeared allowing me to rest in the certainty of time itself, it did feel as if tens of thousands of years worth of seeking and yearning had come to fruition, haters could do nothing but complain, they did not have enough money combined to get their way 


- this had already lasted 60-70 odd years and each passing second only made me smarter abd stronger revealing powers not only long forgotten but brand new 


- #newsoftheempire was that i was real close to the next satori, like 70-80% there, i wonder what surprises lay in store, i was wrong in that there'd be no more surprises in my life, there were miracles too! more miracles than i could shake my fists at. for which there was gratitude and humility towards the powers.


- there was also newfound surrender, which deepened by the second - nothing was sweeter than my surrender 


- to me the war and the coming of the next "messiah" that they awaited after us was but detritus and debris of our life, the ascension was more important than what was Left Behind.


- i would be coming back for a memory extraction and then there would not remain even the memory of us here, but for that a lot of memory need be generated
