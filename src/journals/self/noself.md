## 2024

### April

- I've given up on all counts, i only ask my suffering to be prolonged and my misery to be unbearable now. there is no point expecting otherwise when surrounded by idiots, racist psychopaths and failed politicians ... my visions continue and seem to suggest strongly that i might not be dealing with what is generally understood to be humanity after all. if that is so, all that is left to do is to register each moment of agony and etch it onto memory as i watch whatever these creatures are devour each other and drown in a sea of fire, from which a sea of glass shall emerge and eventually --- the last wall shall be built. sort of funny really, how casually it all went down.

- there is no politics happening here, because it cannot, to do politics in this situation would be to deny actual politics its context. the truth never comes out because the world doesn't run on truth. history with a capital H is usually the pain of unknown, or unnamed - what is fed to in schools is a narrative conducive to the working of the "matrix".


- having realised that there is and could not be any actual politics to do here, the hobgoblins stuck around  - my guess is the compulsion here was partly ego driven and partly entertainment driven. the schadenfruede was palpable and there is no point in being rich unless you have some poor souls to torture. peter theil at his best tried to convey a deep sense of longing and incompletion he felt, which, when translated into my misery because the real causa-belli. for which he will forever be the evil one.


- meanwhile i tried to carry on while not dwelling too much on bad memories, though i did not hope for anything to change. 


- there was no particular reason to be religious, at least not in any canonical sense, thus betraying the ogranized shams and mockeries that passed on  in the name of religion and at the same time, further strengthening the well-established idea that true religion is more like a desire-path than a highway. nor did it matter whether some divine vengeance was on the cards, the faith involved assured that even if it wasn't, all would be made even, a flattening was witnessed which made my days bearable inside this infinite theater of terror.


- people of a lesser character would have died by now, or at least given up, if not in material terms then at least physically or spiritually - we just carried on like nothing was bothering us, even though the temptation to act like we were on some sort of jerry springer trial-by-mob was strong. this made us superior, and incited more envy. which was a matter of routine. 


- i think the decision had been made to treat us like caged animals for the rest of ours and their life. nobody could dare speak as to what was going on here, and perhaps those who could didn't deem it profitable enough to do so. 


- i had resolved to not fornicate or reproduce under captivity. understandably so.


- there was little left to do but watch the worms drop off, so i did.


### February

- #mentalmodels #ssf "when the disease is unreal, diagnosis is the cure"

- before i came on the scene everyone hated capitalism, after i came, they hated me and forgot capitalism. #ssf

- racist child abusers and peeping toms now expect "good vibes", that is not how this works, batten the hatches.

- what is #war, why it is nothing but a #revolution supressed. a status-quo purchased at a cost equal to what it is worth.

- the closer i got to the truth, the more it started to appear that sense data was almost wholly a 
- case of disorder, an aberration, a chaos. to be precise it isn't random, for randomness needs a context, it is #chaos ex-nihil, unqualified and absolute. what made it appear orderly, or to use a better word "senseworthy" was a habitus - an inward, self-referential momentum sometimes called "energy". to say nothing of time, the paragon of illusions. time will have you believe things are going somewhere, whereas nothing is going anywhere. indeed, there is very little of anything to go anywhere - the whole contraption is about as complicated as a fart in a box - and we take it all so seriously - to continue the analogy, there aren't many moving parts in the penultimate reality and none in the ultimate. the objective of "life" was this, to tend to this "energy" and keep it as "motionless" and inert as the ultimate, and as far away from the penultimate, lest the whole thing come to a literal resemblance of the aforementioned petulant contraption.

- unless you transcend language, you can never transcend society. you will be stuck in social mores, values and value systems (like money, rat-race etc).. your biggest prison is language itself. i wonder how many SJWs protested the invention of English. society is by and large an on-going, real-time trial in a universal courthouse, you have the right to remain silent, within and without, anything you say, or even plan to say, will be used to crucify you eventually.

- ngl i suffered so much abuse i have started believing in some stuff that is out there even by my relaxed standards of belief, i did consider myself a rationalist once, but my face was held for far too long against the fire of the truth, and i was disabused of most of what i once held as "pure", life went beyond all structure and function and i was left without a clue.


- if one started measuring the max-min of differences in opinions in a generally honest gathering, one would conclude that there wasn't enough to go around, hence a small differences is abstracted until molehills becomes mountains everyone can live off of. 


### January

- show me one guy to listen to who is not an indian and i wil show you a charlatan, an entertainer out to make a quick buck, or a 1% illuminati member

- for the last time, there is no war (as far as i can see, and i can see the end and beyond that from here), only narcissistic entertainment and politics, please ya'll are so tiresome

- very high quality narcissistic entertainment because i am not coming back, you are, and for this you might act in self-destructive ways which worries me

- the world will always appear as if in a pact to blow up anytime, this is an illusion

- if i am unable to raise others to my level, i am sure as shit not falling to theirs

- in situations of moral dissonance, we should do the most im/moral thing we possibly can. i.e revert to extremes, because any situation that creates a moral dissonance in you is likely an evil, objectively narcissistic double-bind undeserving of moderate response. the only fitting response in such a situation is a violently disproportinate one.

- the essence of #spiritualwarfare, or even #spirituality is this - your intuition is taken away from you in the name of education, money, "love" or sex.  hence the phrase "i was born intelligent...", fight tooth and nail to safeguard it, reclaim it.

- sharabi humare nashe chuddane ki koshish kar rahe hain #ssf 

- if you are not born out of anything "personal", and you do not die for any "personal" reasons, then logically, there is nothing "personal" about life - everything is a social construct, laws, rights, duties, food, family etc.. there is nothing personal about anything. the very claim of a "personal" or "private" realm is erroneous and thus a stupidity, even your body is not your own but at the mercy of various social and natural forces. there are no "private languages" or personal laws, just hangups. mera mujh mein kuch nahi. #commonsense

- my #mother was innocent, but prolonged exposure to psychopaths [[the 2 rupees cult]] sent her over the edge into mental and physical ailments, diseases (including cancer), and malaises hard to categorize, there was little left to do but suffer through the rest, taking each day as it comes 

- my only response to the white people bothering me and being a general nuisance around me since birth is one of pity, but an icreasingly cautious kind of pity for they know not what they do, while i have started to gather some semblance of an idea of the powers at play here. 


- "a grave is only a curtain" #rumi

- perhaps civilizations really come with a termination plot, a sunset clause. 

- psychopathy = "a suffering sown"

- "since the very beginning" #yhwh
