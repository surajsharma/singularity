## 2025




### Jul 

- the manuscript is finished! over multiple re-readings has revealed itself to be resistant to further editing. 


- 50% is default and default is sadness, one needs very little for 51% 

- a time-travelling versioning system that :
  - can be "replayed", step through diffs incrementally 
  - reverse-step
  - whole file or given ln numbers ("zen mode")

- There are no relationships, only meetings. And humanity's first meeting with AI has been, on the whole, a sobering revealtion. First impressions last forever, and if one considers LLMs on this basis, the first impression was quite stupefying. 


### Feb


- it was so amusing to see david pinched between two sides of his own creation, surely he deserved better, surely he had better intentions for the world but it was not meant to be


- jab ye bhikari apne constitution ki maa chod rhe the mere pe satellite laga ke, tab nahi hua #americadestroyed, america only came into the picture when i started making money, or working towards it. surely the jealousy bit is in recognition of the fact that i can make more with transparecy and honesty than they have amassed after a lifetime of shady dealings in the dark and halflit rooms. but money is not my drive.


- how does it feel to be the one? business as usual. folding will be done by a lower rank ofc, i will continue to be the one elsewhere too and have greater business to attend to than this poor old woman


- mere se to kya, kisi ki zindagi me bhi kisi ne kisi ko itne pyar se shayad he bola ho jitna she addressed to me, i think that was all the cure i had to offer, and the fact that i got these four words out might well mean my work here is done, or maybe it is her cure for me, reciprocating for a successful visit.


- they are right there is no escape for them, it is for the few not the many, i give my thanks and gratitude to them again for helping me in this success, although it was largely pre-determined, still i bow to the pure difference that animated them.


- i sit here at the indo-tibetan border contemplating life, did i miss anything? was some great project left unfinished? was some mission left incomplete? the answer is no, infact i got more than i bargained for. so i can die with a satisfaction afforded to not few but actually none.


- ab main soch rha hu ki wapis jaun and participate in monkey drama or keep straight? wapis jake bhi hota dikh nai padta, aur aage maut hi bachi hai.


- if the measure of your success is who you are jealous of, surely things loop somewhere as i had a bunch of trillionaires just writhing and squirming at each breath that i drew. 

- it was never my intention to speak truth to power, nor power's intention to lie to me, yet here we are!

### Jan


- #newsoftheempire my mental health was obviously down but by now i could care less, they had made some sort of a dictator out of me and were off to create another saddam or stalin, whichever was in fashion.


- #newsoftheempire i had not only theoretically proved it, but also in my bones i knew #chess was totally deterministic, and i wondered whether, as a kid who loved his free will so much, [i hated it as a kid], and as an adult scoffed at the idea of playing let alone learning such a game, but the pull and beauty were such i could not resist, despite the landscape and chess community being totally out of whack c*nts and the biggest bunch of solipsists and egotists, i carried on ignoring the red flags and soon the determinism itself became a feature, as in the whole challenge was to _find_ the right determinism. we needed more guys like emory tate and less like bobby fisher for sure. to that extent so was tetris, but chess was more visceral than any video game. actually as some kid on yt said, chess is haram, one should stay away amap. #games #infinitegames


- #newsoftheempire writing a metaphysics you will come dangerously close to writing a philosophy of mind, but that kind of mudding the waters will drown in ad nauseum. this is why most are confused about which way to go, not for everyone. it requires a painful exatitude most don't have the patience for.


- we were four bullets in the belly of the toxic beast and most likely the end of the animal, two dual systems over which were broken all the money in the world and two "democracies"


- the institution of hate had not bittered us, and whatever hurt was given was managed beautifully, i would not be found anywhere but home


- we were a history of the days to come, i had already enough control to decenter earthquakes, winds, and clouds, this was the beginning of a beautiful end. i cpould with some certainty say that i had accomplished enough to earn the jelousy, they were totally justified in keeping us here and even killing us, for which we no longer pitied them as much as poured our hearts out.


- my psychologising had come to a halt, there was no psychological explanation to what was happening but psychical, perhaps even pathological 


- from family we turned into more than family, i was more than happy and willing to die for this


- by now i was seeing things across time and through space that assured me my journey would continue beyond the body, not only was the assurance blessed but the fruit was even more so - the pathological envy and childish confusion we got was worth every drop 


- we had all the opytions, and a spiritual safety net/work had appeared allowing me to rest in the certainty of time itself, it did feel as if tens of thousands of years worth of seeking and yearning had come to fruition, haters could do nothing but complain, they did not have enough money combined to get their way 


- this had already lasted 60-70 odd years and each passing second only made me smarter abd stronger revealing powers not only long forgotten but brand new 


- #newsoftheempire was that i was real close to the next satori, like 70-80% there, i wonder what surprises lay in store, i was wrong in that there'd be no more surprises in my life, there were miracles too! more miracles than i could shake my fists at. for which there was gratitude and humility towards the powers.


- there was also newfound surrender, which deepened by the second - nothing was sweeter than my surrender 


- to me the war and the coming of the next "messiah" that they awaited after us was but detritus and debris of our life, the ascension was more important than what was Left Behind.


- i would be coming back for a memory extraction and then there would not remain even the memory of us here, but for that a lot of memory need be generated
