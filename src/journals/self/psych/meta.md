1. even if i don't claim ESP, some sort of special, highly precise, non-verbal communication is implied in everything i do. of course body language is a part of it, but i am able to broadcast exact words to those who care to pay attention, or are somehow locked in, how is this possible? how am i able to communicate this precisely? truly i have done away with words in more than one sense.
2. there is more than one interpretation of death
3. there's a rhythm to it, the bird dictated
4. experiment with speeds, thinking fast and slow to induce bias

5. either because of me, or despite me, the people who came in contact with me, were somehow exalted, not sure what happened, nobody was doing anything any differently than they usually would, despite or because of themselves
