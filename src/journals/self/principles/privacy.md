total privacy leads to the samprivacye place zero privacy does



"Whether or not it draws on new scientific research, technology is a branch of moral philosophy, not of science. 
PAUL GOODMAN, New Reformation”



Excerpt From: Neil Postman. "Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology”. Apple Books. 



Information is naturally social, a solitary individual wouldn't be able to produce meaningful data (about themselves OR about the world around them, and may well be speaking in a 'private language'), even if they have compelling reasons to log it, it wouldn't mean much outside of their solipsism. Data becomes information only after it steps into social arena.



"Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you dont care about free speech because you have nothing to say" - Snowden



LOL



WATCH ME DISMANTLE THIS POSITION IN THE SPACE BELOW



Privacy is not absolute and can be traded just like hours in the days of our lives are traded when we pick up a trade, profession or calling. Data privacy is as fundamental a right as the right on our time, which is to say, like all fundamental rights, it too is malleable. Besides, there are cameras everywhere already, it was only a matter of time what we did here happened, isn't it a blessing that it happened semi-consciously and semi-deliberately instead of being a total accident? What kind of tragedy would we be looking at then?



So, saying you care about data privacy even though you have nothing special to share with the world is like saying i have ten free hours in the day i consciously choose to waste because I've been taught to hide my best bits from the public, to be secretive and individualistic. How long do you think that logic is going to fly given where tech has reached?


> Data is the new oil? Did you ever think who/where the well is?


1. Who gets to say what and when is tightly controlled, even western liberal media isnt free, such is the nature of democracy in late capitalism.

2. If FS leads to disastrous consequenses it isnt FS as i've demonstrated

3. Most people do have nothing to saya nd just want to live peaceful lives

4. I dont care about privacy because i DO believe in FS and i DO have sth to say (and am saying it all the time)

5. Most freedoms aren't dependent on data "privacy" or anything that resembles it. A few are, but it is debatable how important those freedoms are, and whether doing away with them isn't altogether beneficial for the planet.


6. First of all, ANY participation in society, by definition, implies a loss of individual rights. The veneer of fundamental rights is a necessary fiction that makes us feel free, when in fact, the individual is everywhere in chains. Every single one of us is bound by a social structure and a social order that is beyond us and we talk of individual freedom as if it even exists. Man is a social creature, rights are commensurate with duties. Some people perform special duties, so their rights to duties ratio is different. Such as soldiers, or even civil servants. But even that is going too far, want to marry that nice girl from gym but mom won't allow? where's your fundamental right? Sure, you could break ties, but then you'd be forsaking other stuff. So everything in life is a tradeoff, lets not be too rigid about rights and such. You're free to spend your time however you want, thats the most basic fundamental right, to do what you wish WITH YOUR TIME, but you must surrender that right and work 8 hours a day so you can make money, pay bills fulfil social obligations etc. Harping on about rights is nothing if not, "motivated ignorance". Sound fascist and sadistic, I know.

Instead of making things better, most of us are just looking for someone to blame while we enjoy our toys.

All of us have become, at some level, caricatures of the very SJWs we despise, I'm  only trying to get us up one level and turn everyone into a journalist instead, how can that be fascist? Why am I doing this? Because I know nobody wants to give up their toys and rights, and indeed, nobody should have to. I'm choosing the lesser evil.

Re point (1), most people are woke in their bliss and ignorance and don't need to be 'woken up', contrary to popular belief, but nobody starts blaring common knowledge in the streets because they've made those tradeoffs. No one is truly free, my effort here is to help us realize and move beyond this dichotomy of free/unfree. We're free in relation with the world in proportion to the quality and quantity of our contribution towards it. As for individualism, what would it even mean in the absense of other people? World is hell, being an individual is a torture, if you cannot endure, become a communist. Otherwise, strive for a rights:duties ratio that puts your soul at ease while calming those around you.

7. Suppose someone invaded your thoughts and started reading them, then you would complain about how they won't let you be but the truth of the matter is most people can't even leave themselves alone. If someone invents a new mic, sure they should be compensated, but people will start complaining about noise pollution even before things start if they presume they can see the future. That's my problem with the left in general, way too pessimistic, whereas from where I stand, the future isn't all bad.

8. (Data) Privacy has no intrinsic value, it only has the value we give it. The difference can be illustrated thusly: if I preface a joke with "here's a joke'" or "let me tell you a joke", it is likely that the impact of the joke will diminish. However, in a public setting like a stand up comedy club, where the intentions of the performer aren't hidden from the crowd, the humour isn't dampened. Similarily, our need for surprise, the need to do stuff with the illusion of our intentions being hidden from the outside world is a socially determined need. It is, in effect, a need for the 'other'. Conversely, it is a need OF the other. In short, I want privacy only because others want it. Which is a loop with no beginning. The need for privacy isn't rooted in biology and even if it is, technology has started the evolutionary cycle that will change all that. I'm just a symptom of this evolutionary drive. Sure, some people with evil intentions still would prefer their plans to remain hidden but such people are the minority.

During Peacetime, Privacy is the illusion allowed by those who think they are in control, to those who would like to think they are in control. During wartime, whoever can keep a secret doesn't necessarily win.

Democratic voting doesn't make something a 'sin', nor does cultural convention produce meaning. Voting and conventions both are ways around the real task of asking difficult questions facing the human race. I say Don't vote, just think.


Peter Sloterdijk

Where is this ego then, if it is neither in the body nor in the soul? Blaise Pascal

Every ego, in or- der to manifest itself and to stand up to public scrutiny, requires a solid nucleus, a pride of ego, which can endure having to appear before others. The greatest breakthrough for the people came when they discovered the language of human rights for themselves. These rights were articulated from the peasant wars of 1525 up until the modern Russian and Polish resistances as the rights of Chris- tians. In the traditions based on the American and French revolutions, they are understood as temporal natural rights.

Geistesgeschichte



The Utopia of conscious life was and remains a world in which we all have the right to be Odysseus and to let that Nobody live, in spite of history, politics, na- tionality, and Somebodiness.



Between the poles of Nobodiness and Somebodiness, the adventures and vicissitudes of con- scious life are strung. In conscious life, every fiction of an ego is dissolved once and for all.



For this reason, Odysseus, and not Hamlet, is the true founding father of modern and everlasting intelligence.
