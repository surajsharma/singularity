The work of bringing health and harmony into our experience is not, then, getting rid of, or even changing, a mortal material universe, but correcting the finite concept of our existence.

mortals put on immortality only as mortality disappearsâ€”they do not add immortal spiritual harmony to human conditions.

We now are engaged in the cultivation of that spiritual sense and we shall succeed in proportion as we relax our mental struggles and become receptive to those things which the Spirit of God teaches.

> Here is the guide. Watch your thoughts, aims, and ambitions for just a short while and see if your mind is on your health, the pleasures of senses, or worldly gain. Then as these worldly thoughts appear, learn to reject them because now we are no longer set on the path of improving our human affairs, but on attaining the spiritual kingdom.

This may all be summed up in Paul's words: "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."

> When confronted with any human problem, instead of laboring for an improved human condition, turn from the picture and realize the presence of the divine Spirit in you. This Spirit dissolves the human seeming and reveals spiritual harmony, though to sight this harmony will appear as improved human health or wealth.
