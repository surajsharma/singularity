Heaven is weary of the luxury of China. I shall remain in the wilderness of the north. I shall return to simplicity and moderation once again. As for the clothes I wear and the food I eat, I shall have the same as cowherds and grooms and I shall treat my soldiers as brothers. In a hundred battles I have been at the forefront and within seven years I have performed a great work, for in the six directions of space all things are subject to one ruler.



After us the people of our race will wear garments of gold, eat sweet greasy food, ride decorated horses, hold the loveliest of women, and will forget the things they owe to us.
