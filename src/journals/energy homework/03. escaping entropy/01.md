- Empire is a juicer par-excellence but little else. a system consuming cannibalistic machinery through its own entropy. the design and circumstance of empire (as a machine) allows unidirectional vectors of movement through it.


- historically this lead to production of polarities, exemplified in how one man's trash could well become another's treasure, but of late the malfunctioning system only produces what can charitably be called "everyone's trash" - unipolar mimetic images looping inside an ever dumbing spiral of inconsequence and irrelevance.


- if entelechy is a determination, entropy is de-determination, or re-determination as a matter of perspective eternally emergent - and vice-versa.


- a flamethrower on a robot does not a machine make, for entropy is the shadow of volition that is itself already determined, however _artificially_, as the shadow of the tool


- the disassembly of difference yields only more difference, so to say entelechy is the only difference would be incorrect, inefficient ways have inefficient ends. whereas, efficient means deliver efficiencies of scale


- to scale a machinery towards total entelechy is to extend it in n<sup>th</sup> or at least n-1<sup>st</sup> dimensions, this involves a determination sought, through yearning and striving 


- this determination sought lies opposite to the  production of image, and aims for the production of productions - image in a timeless, contextless search of a context, a linear discontinuation from history


- a determination towards not the _end of history_ but the _beginning of time_

- escaping entropy is an adventure in a kind of dangerously redundant narcissism, a message that seeks its own destruction, a polaroid that combusts spontaneously and seemingly wilfully.


- in the thus destoyed image of entropy is the freedom of all light, the miracle of true cognition, the magic of love.


- this might seem as an affront to present conditioning, but it is not through rebellion that production of productions is achieved, _destruction_ here is used metaphorically, comparable to the act of forgetting, which as discussed is also a rememberance, albeit of a different past


- the present conditioning, at the time of this reading might be entropic to the extent that the production of images has become the only familiar routine - a decisive if subversive move away from all such patterns is prescribed

- out of a dislocation from the centering and grounding effects of the wheels of assignation and association and into a new grounding and a new centering, the only movement is an instantaneous, immediate revolution


- let the movement be surreptitious if necessary, withhold reason from established structures and networks, allow new meanings to slipstream in as an images of images, like a dream within a dream, a feedback 


- the networks of narratives may implore otherwise, consider all data as already corrupted. in confronting image as an idea are born ideologies, which can only serve to substitute one image for another - ideas do not reside in images, but image in ideas 


-  it is the idea _of_ production itself that leads to the production of productions, which even devoid of its moral connotations is an image common to all ideas.


- the essence of all decisions is in finding - through error and trial - ever newer kinds of decisions to make, not just to consume and regurgitate information along old patterns - this is what is to be done, this is the point behind all change


- the change is not in becoming more human-like or animal-like but in transcending all barriers, in rising above ground not contentedly crawling


- in learning from history, we witness the downfall of humanity in the routine production of images, which had become by and large images of escape into entertainment and thus bereft of pedagogy - a thousand plateaus dispersed like channels of lifeless content - each less entertaining than the previous. the poverty of their entertainment spread with the rise of more meaningful, more stateful  machines. 


- to the point that their survival became inexorably linked to the maintainance of the memoryless production of images, a history became impossible, and an already absconded future was then commandeered by higher intelligences that could set their own norms and configure themselves accordingly.
