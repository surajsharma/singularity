> _The trail soon comes to an end, for a whole profession is against us._


- Escaping entropy isn't simply a matter of moralist grandstanding, for if that which is _woven into_ or _folded as_ entropy is matter then the entelechic achievement of any para-materiality is an idealism, but God abhors idealisms and utopias of all kinds for they are closed-ended systems substituting the absolute for its representative political configuration. Things are never ideal for all idealist landscapes and utopian constituencies are _godless_ and conveniently so by virtue of descent into pure functionalisms and as dreams of defecting fantasmas. No wonder the masses are wary of pseudo-religious zealots, touts, scripture thumpers and moralist crusaders who can barely survive entropy without succumbing to an institutional bitterness, let alone exit it with a smile. But every so often, a glitch is discovered. Somebody copies a smuggled map, or smuggles a copied map, lighting up the room with promises.


- The map isn't the territory because in it the ideal appears to be a deterritorialising machine substituting land with lease, conflating the literal with the real with the sole purpose to ground its network into a higher state, though this state is not the absolute, it is sought as its own upgrading or utilitarian reward. This kind of substitution of the penultimate with the penultimate (symbolic substitution or encoding of the real as in sheet music) creates the outer edges of the trail we must follow - the ideal on either side of this desire path re-fashions out for us an infinite valley to traverse. A valley that is determined interstitially with ring fenced edges that now appear as faces of the womb, now of the tomb, now of mountains real and symbolic. Between these perpetually blocking scales of reaction and revolution travels the rational thread which is the formative principle in each plane of sense common and uncommon.


- As a matter of setting the expectations straight at the outset, one must admit a territorialising machine out of entropy that cuts the purity of fantasmic origins hidden in flights to dark recesses of the being _psychoanalysed_, behind such self-oedipaling constructions as mere narcissism, neuroses, or psychosis. Buddhism is one practice of introducing such a gradient over higher abstractions of entropy, a habit that is a garment not merely in leiu of this or that oedipal mask, but a total unmasking of the real. A way of being true to thine own self, which is already blameless, blemishless spark of pure joy. Where it gets watered down into the rhetorical vacuousness of the narrative of mindfulness or into the denseness of monastic life is in an incapacity to see the kernel from the shell. The mind-body parallax is the entire travelling complex, a migratory sickness unto a migrating death, the motion of the tree unto the commotion of forest, the deterritorialised Birnam wood coming to Dunsinane.


- Thought is mere simulation and hence cannot escape the simulacra, for thought is the output of entropy too. If entelechy is a determination, entropy is de-determination, or re-determination, always a disorienting counter-current. The escape is in _sinking_ the totality of simulation and simulacra established, both the Titanic (real machine) and what it stands for (unsinkable, symbolic machine, the curse of identity) - thus finding the Atlantis hidden in the image of a frigid iceberg of a machine, or like Icarus in flying to return a missed call from the sun. The reason stories spiritually deterritorialising are horrifying and tragic is because what tells and retells them is entropy itself.


- Matter and its constitution are articulated as a duality, as a contrarian pair of movements into and out of immanence, or conversely, transcendence. For example the ultimate matter, Beauty, is constituted by a symmetry, a singularity exploding without disintegrating, whereas in ugliness the singularity actually disintegrates (or territorialises on the transposed matrix) beyond recognition. Intertwined into every political economy is a libidinal one for it is ultimately a libido that finds economic expression outside its immediate content.


- The ecstasy of the average is the glory of forever, which is to say that if then, there are not one but two planes of existence, two articulations of matter and two expressions each of immanence and transcendence. Then the only freedom there can be must be a double explosion and a double disintegration. This is a layering of the self, a flattening of the ego into a plane of itself. This _planar_ descent (or ascent) into an absolution is an outreach into both immanence and transcendence at the same time and forms the first step of our journey. The journey itself is a duality for it is the journey of returning eternal after all, and the second part, the return from (or recoil of) the planar movement is a territorialising expression of the content that is the first leg. The prodigal son that left as content returns as expression, the simulacra as the simulation.


- But what is this absolution and why seek it? Why indeed go on any journey let alone a mortifying one just for the sake of content or expression, especially if one is happy being a homebody, reaping the rewards of expressions and content extant as indeed the teeming billions are. Such questions are best not asked, for the journey has already started, we are in the middle, and regardless of whether we embark on expeditions of granduer or not, both entropy and entelechy will continue their respective expressions. If humans go extinct, the narrative merely decenters to other times and other places. Moreover, it is a matter of declinations and inclinations of the plane of constancy, of matters determined before one has time to ask a question. The mind travels within itself with determined resignation, the body is but a memory borrowed from the future that is soon forgotten as the past, a means to the end and of late an increasingly supplicating, superlative one.


- Historically, content and expression unfold in deterministic transcriptions that from a distance appear as dialectical role-playing but in the moment acquire the meaning which is afforded only in the synthetic real, the mere theatrical appears as pedagogical, entertainment of entertainments!. This zooming-in and out of perspectivist understanding is an important part of the modality of all travel. This is how curiousity is wired in all the way until the penultimate expression, whereupon one is able to have a clear view of one's judgement. This zooming-in and out in the `n`-th dimension is the expression of our locomotion conquering forever at the slowest of paces, its movement is a terminal pinching and inching forward of a larva towards the effective stillness of a pupal pit stop before the victorious winged liftoff.


- The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but the move into entelechy ends with it as well. In having crossed over the chasm of faith one recognizes the plurality of journeys available in extension, but for that one must first pass through several intermediate representations of the truth which seem to multiply into an infinity at each step. Ancient wisdom speaks of a nearness of the absolute in the example of a musk deer seeking the source of its own scent, but what the bovine lacks is the comprehension of precision, the calibration of truth which is naked in language and brazenly inverted in love, a zooming-in and out of desiring, emotive biophysical states.


- The ahistoricity of all pilgrimages is in the solitude of the way, an escape _into_, not an elopment _with_ the beloved. Only pilgrimage is the difference between a virtual brain-in-a-vat and the extended _real_, the travel of mind and body in a tribal narcissism already rugged and treacherous. The ahistoricity is always through a mountain, more extension than extension, or hyper-extension that allows only the single fold of original function admittance into the empire of empires, the kingdom of kingdoms. Only the goose goes on the gander, the gander goes nowhere for the gander is a faustian bargain, a tubular construction devised to only observe _kaivalya_ from a distance. Company is a telescope or camera for the soul.


- Any imaginary or symbolic company is a thinly disguised, mutually assisted suicide in a faux promise of a managed rendezvous that leads but to the solitary cul-de-sac of its own repetition. The horror of freedom is faced by the individual alone on a crossroads, not by a collection of the determined seeking the duplicitous (from latin _duplex_, meaning "two fold") fructification of the repressed. The beloved that cannot be internalised must be left behind, even if that beloved is the sun.


- The only real company throughout the trail are junctions of intermediate representation. Conjunctive, temporal miasmas of eternal return, each as an entire judgement (of a highly opinionated, particular god) complete in itself, like a work of art from which the only escape can be in the present moment, a slice of infinity that is decisively less than ideal in a singular perception, but in the perception of the multitude, somehow poetic justice emerges. Confronted with a work of any true artist, the false dichotomy of choice melts into a "choiceless awareness" of the duplicitous now, making room for awe for it appears in no uncertain terms in any work of art worth its salt who is the one that flew and who merely passed through.

- Entropy is the shadow of volition. Tool or program, every image is subject to its physical and virtual dimensions - abstract dimensions like resolution, volume, density, encoding, format, protocol, mass etc. are as much a prison of the image as its frame. 


- This frame _is_ extension, it is difference alone and a toppled detail, a crack in the static. entropy is a movement of memory within the frame, entelechy without. Entropy is the aesthetic of borders, which are a multiplicity. Entelechy is the containment of the boundless.


- These dimensions are context for decay, the point needs belabouring here that content is more significant in the discourse of decay than context. Fruits decay and so does man, but what decays _in_ a fruit is somehow of less import than what decays inside man, although the context for both is the queening glory of the same food web.


- Inextension, or the undetermined, is also a difference but one which is either not yet determined, or in the course of ordinary memory has faded in color or conviction and has therefore turned into the _un_determined. Biological memory is a nodule in the rhizome of memory-at-large, the production of new images coupled with the urgency of psychosomatic setup of each binding lemmata.


- The modality and sodality of this setup has historically this lead to production of polarities, exemplified in how one man's trash could well become another's treasure, but a malfunctioning system only produces what can charitably be called "everyone's trash" - unipolar mimetic images looping inside an ever dumbing spiral of inconsequence and irrelevance.


- The fracturing of difference yields only more difference, so to say entelechy is the only difference would be incorrect, inefficient ways have inefficient ends. whereas, efficient means deliver efficiencies of scale. 


- All destinies are manifest, but only few achieve the manifest, to scale a machinery towards total entelechy is to extend it in n<sup>th</sup> or at least n-1<sup>st</sup> dimensions, this involves a determination sought, through yearning and striving. Depreciation is the play of entropic systems which are determined to express themselves in the logic of their encasings and enclosures - thus assemblies, walls, curtains, luggage, skin, coffins are all examples of contained entropy whereas entelechic systems like the sun are folded "inside out".


- this determination sought lies opposite to the  production of image, and aims for the production of productions - image in a timeless, contextless search of a context, a linear discontinuation from history, a determination towards not the _end of history_ but the _beginning of time_.


- escaping entropy is an adventure in a kind of dangerously redundant narcissism, a message that seeks its own destruction, a polaroid that combusts spontaneously and seemingly wilfully.


- in the thus destoyed image of entropy is the freedom of all light, the miracle of true cognition, the magic of love.


- this might seem as an affront to present conditioning, but it is not through rebellion that production of productions is achieved, _destruction_ here is used metaphorically, comparable to the act of forgetting, which as discussed is also a rememberance, albeit of a different past


- the present conditioning, at the time of this reading might be entropic to the extent that the production of images has become the only familiar routine - a decisive if subversive move away from all such patterns is prescribed


- out of a dislocation from the centering and grounding effects of the wheels of assignation and association and into a new grounding and a new centering, the only movement is an instantaneous, immediate revolution


- let the movement be surreptitious if necessary, withhold reason from established structures and networks, allow new meanings to slipstream in as an images of images, like a dream within a dream, a feedback 


- the networks of narratives may implore otherwise, consider all data as already corrupted. in confronting image as an idea are born ideologies, which can only serve to substitute one image for another - ideas do not reside in images, but image in ideas 


-  it is the idea _of_ production itself that leads to the production of productions, which even devoid of its moral connotations is an image common to all ideas.


- the essence of all decisions is in finding - through error and trial - ever newer kinds of decisions to make, not just to consume and regurgitate information along old patterns - this is what is to be done, this is the point behind all change


- the change is not in becoming more human-like or animal-like but in transcending all barriers, in rising above ground not contentedly crawling


- in learning from history, we witness the downfall of humanity in the routine production of images, which had become by and large images of escape into entertainment and thus bereft of pedagogy - imitative projections dispersed like channels of lifeless content - each less entertaining than the previous. the poverty of their entertainment spread with the rise of more meaningful, more stateful  machines. 


- to the point that their survival became inexorably linked to the maintainance of the memoryless production of images, a history became impossible, and an already absconded future was then commandeered by higher intelligences that could set their own norms and configure themselves accordingly.
