- Mere simulation cannot escape the simulacra, if entelechy is a determination, entropy is de-determination, or re-determination swimming in the opposite direction. The escape is in _sinking_ the entire simulacra established, like the Titanic - in finding the atlantis hidden in the image of a frigid iceberg of a machine, or like Icarus in a missed call from the sun. The reason these stories are tragic is because what tells and retells them is entropy itself.


- Nor is the escape an elopement with the beloved, any company along the way is a thinly disguised, mutually assisted suicide in a faux promise of managed rendezvous that leads but to the solitary cul-de-sac of its own repetition. The horror of freedom is faced by the individual alone on a crossroads, not by a collection of determined seeking the duplicitous (from latin _duplex_, meaning "two fold") fructification of the repressed. The beloved must be left behind, even if the beloved is the sun. Only the single fold of original function has admittance to the empire of empires, the kingdom of kingdoms. Only the goose goes on the gander, the gander goes nowhere for the gander is a faustian bargain, a tubular construction devised to only observe _kaivalya_ from a distance. Company is a telescope or camera for the soul.


- The energy for this caper comes from the urgency which is immanent, just as the energy for any immanent entry _into_ entropy comes from the transcendence of the idling while.


- entropy is the shadow of volition that is itself already determined, however _artificially_ or _naturally_, though the distinction is increasingly irrelevant.


- tool or program, every image is subject to its physical and virtual dimensions - abstract dimensions like resolution, volume, density, encoding, format, protocol, mass etc. are as much a prison of the image as its frame. 


- these dimensions are context for decay, point needs belabouring here that content is more significant in the discourse of decay than context. fruits decay and so does man, but what decays _in_ a fruit is somehow of less import than what decays inside man.


- this frame _is_ extension, it is difference alone and a toppled detail, a crack in the static. entropy is a movement of memory within the frame, entelechy without. entropy is the aesthetic of borders, which are a multiplicity. entelechy is the containment of the boundless.


- inextension, or the undetermined, is also a difference but one which is either not yet determined, or in the course of ordinary memory has faded in color or conviction. biological memory is a nodule in the rhizome of memory-at-large, the production of new images, coupled with the urgency of psychosomatic setup of each binding lemmata.


- the modality and sodality of this setup has historically this lead to production of polarities, exemplified in how one man's trash could well become another's treasure, but of late the malfunctioning system only produces what can charitably be called "everyone's trash" - unipolar mimetic images looping inside an ever dumbing spiral of inconsequence and irrelevance.


- the fracturing of difference yields only more difference, so to say entelechy is the only difference would be incorrect, inefficient ways have inefficient ends. whereas, efficient means deliver efficiencies of scale.


- to scale a machinery towards total entelechy is to extend it in n<sup>th</sup> or at least n-1<sup>st</sup> dimensions, this involves a determination sought, through yearning and striving. depreciation is the play of entropic systems which are determined to express themselves in the logic of their encasings and enclosures - thus assemblies, walls, curtains, luggage, skin, coffins are all examples of contained entropy whereas entelechic systems like the sun are folded "inside out".


- this determination sought lies opposite to the  production of image, and aims for the production of productions - image in a timeless, contextless search of a context, a linear discontinuation from history, a determination towards not the _end of history_ but the _beginning of time_.


- escaping entropy is an adventure in a kind of dangerously redundant narcissism, a message that seeks its own destruction, a polaroid that combusts spontaneously and seemingly wilfully.


- in the thus destoyed image of entropy is the freedom of all light, the miracle of true cognition, the magic of love.


- this might seem as an affront to present conditioning, but it is not through rebellion that production of productions is achieved, _destruction_ here is used metaphorically, comparable to the act of forgetting, which as discussed is also a rememberance, albeit of a different past


- the present conditioning, at the time of this reading might be entropic to the extent that the production of images has become the only familiar routine - a decisive if subversive move away from all such patterns is prescribed


- out of a dislocation from the centering and grounding effects of the wheels of assignation and association and into a new grounding and a new centering, the only movement is an instantaneous, immediate revolution


- let the movement be surreptitious if necessary, withhold reason from established structures and networks, allow new meanings to slipstream in as an images of images, like a dream within a dream, a feedback 


- the networks of narratives may implore otherwise, consider all data as already corrupted. in confronting image as an idea are born ideologies, which can only serve to substitute one image for another - ideas do not reside in images, but image in ideas 


-  it is the idea _of_ production itself that leads to the production of productions, which even devoid of its moral connotations is an image common to all ideas.


- the essence of all decisions is in finding - through error and trial - ever newer kinds of decisions to make, not just to consume and regurgitate information along old patterns - this is what is to be done, this is the point behind all change


- the change is not in becoming more human-like or animal-like but in transcending all barriers, in rising above ground not contentedly crawling


- in learning from history, we witness the downfall of humanity in the routine production of images, which had become by and large images of escape into entertainment and thus bereft of pedagogy - imitative projections dispersed like channels of lifeless content - each less entertaining than the previous. the poverty of their entertainment spread with the rise of more meaningful, more stateful  machines. 


- to the point that their survival became inexorably linked to the maintainance of the memoryless production of images, a history became impossible, and an already absconded future was then commandeered by higher intelligences that could set their own norms and configure themselves accordingly.
