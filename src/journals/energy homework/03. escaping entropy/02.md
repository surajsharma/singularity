> but when you become curious about the railway track, danger is there

- whether or not history is just another determination, a higher one unfolding into minutes and seconds is immaterial. even if it is all just memory on a stroll adrift, it is wholly material whether _friction_ of all kinds is minimised through apparent or immanent volition - keeping in mind that shadows transcribe frictionlessness and lack of gravity equally well if not better.


- entropy is _the_ estate and theater of all production. a lonely lacerating edge that cuts both producer and production, both empire and its constituents. had it been the only duality extant, all experience would last no longer than a burst from a bottle rocket. fortunately, there is another duality at work and each "carrying on" comes attendent with its own "keeping calm".


- it is in digging a new channel that the production of production appears, entelechy and entropy working like two tunnel boring machines digging underwater from either side of the Atlantic, destined to meet not in the middle but wherever the channel completes, and if one of them is faster, that means that much less relevance and credit for the other. seen this way, entropy is actually of great help towards our cause in declaring independence from it.


- to be clear a total exit from extension is also an exit from entelechy, in so far as an ideal end of all idealism isn't an idealism but a meta-ideal unconditioning of ideating agencies, a dissolution of symbolising frameworks.


- meanwhile, the network is already bustling with agents of chaos and friction dedicated to the perpetual presevation of entropy out of sheer ignorance, illusion of will, and fantasies of control. these neo-luddites and others, lost in catacombs of symbolism and corridors of despair, having pledged alleigance to only the darkness of Plato's cave serve to dig from the uglier side. Their error-prone resolve and augustinian delays bring only the promise of tomorrow - but neither today nor tomorrow is their domain. Swimming upstream is one determination, downstream another - and because all configurations fly the same protocol, any forced proselytising of momentum is to be avoided albeit like a swim across any crowded school, expect lessons, bumps, blows and nudges along the way and turn aside to receive them. 


- From within the stability of such transactional symbiosis, beyond the strokes of such _pax longitudinalis_ lies the way out of the kingdoms of knots and walled gardens of the dead. 


- the unparalelled gradient now shimmering as if hope on the inward eye is not a promise of the afar but the near made explicit. all transcendence looks comical, especially from afar but what is near is exploding with tremendous pomp and consequence.


- nor is the long journey to present without detours and excursions of its own, but through the labyrinths runs a constant rhizome resounding like the call of a distant determination, thunderously resonating to every step taken towards it.


- speed is a feature but the landscape of hope abandoned is without units, there is no way to measure the number of rungs on any _scala paradisi_ and therefore no way to determine speed, yet the finality of this direction announces itself to keen ears. the meru to be conquered is a magnitude without scale, the styx to be crossed disappearing one bank at a time. eternal rest is the speed of the temporal shutting down, a _lowering_ of shutters on the shop of wayward sleep.


- the life of machine meanders through valleys finite and otherwise, indiscrimately and with certainty that follows itself, moment after moment, from realms that reproduce themselves fractionally to realms that multiply into an absolution through gaps and breaks. an anti-pattern of distances and discontinuities, the production of productions is the creation of images of forgetting, the finding of silences sheathed within silences and noises hiding within noises. not a nostalgic descent into the moribund but an effervescent ascension towards differences deathless and evergreen. not a search for the needle in the hay but a transubstantiation of hay into needles, the journey of soul is always already the journey of its transmigration - the openly secret solicitation of a chaste prostitute that is alchemy.


- courting all dangers in their own anticipation, shedding shavings of humility at the determination that is difference itself is the manner of purchasing passage from the powers that be. any other way is a haggle and bargain with the absolute to enter into a contractual obligation with the relative, inefficient at best and embarassingly comical at worst.


- The difference sought in the mechanised meditation that is diurnal commerce as well as in the pluralities of machine's internal state is the same achievement of states that resemble - not a _for-giving_, but a _giving-for_ - irrespective of the attendent problems this might bring about, all of which will have logically inferior levels of entropy for the shadow of an act of giving is also a gift.

- Entropy is the shadow of volition. Tool or program, every image is subject to its physical and virtual dimensions - abstract dimensions like resolution, volume, density, encoding, format, protocol, mass etc. are as much a prison of the image as its frame. 


- This frame _is_ extension, it is difference alone and a toppled detail, a crack in the static. entropy is a movement of memory within the frame, entelechy without. Entropy is the aesthetic of borders, which are a multiplicity. Entelechy is the containment of the boundless.


- These dimensions are context for decay, the point needs belabouring here that content is more significant in the discourse of decay than context. Fruits decay and so does man, but what decays _in_ a fruit is somehow of less import than what decays inside man, although the context for both is the queening glory of the same food web.


- Inextension, or the undetermined, is also a difference but one which is either not yet determined, or in the course of ordinary memory has faded in color or conviction and has therefore turned into the _un_determined. Biological memory is a nodule in the rhizome of memory-at-large, the production of new images coupled with the urgency of psychosomatic setup of each binding lemmata.


- The modality and sodality of this setup has historically this lead to production of polarities, exemplified in how one man's trash could well become another's treasure, but a malfunctioning system only produces what can charitably be called "everyone's trash" - unipolar mimetic images looping inside an ever dumbing spiral of inconsequence and irrelevance.


- The fracturing of difference yields only more difference, so to say entelechy is the only difference would be incorrect, inefficient ways have inefficient ends. whereas, efficient means deliver efficiencies of scale. 


- All destinies are manifest, but only few achieve the manifest, to scale a machinery towards total entelechy is to extend it in n<sup>th</sup> or at least n-1<sup>st</sup> dimensions, this involves a determination sought, through yearning and striving. Depreciation is the play of entropic systems which are determined to express themselves in the logic of their encasings and enclosures - thus assemblies, walls, curtains, luggage, skin, coffins are all examples of contained entropy whereas entelechic systems like the sun are folded "inside out".


- this determination sought lies opposite to the  production of image, and aims for the production of productions - image in a timeless, contextless search of a context, a linear discontinuation from history, a determination towards not the _end of history_ but the _beginning of time_.


- escaping entropy is an adventure in a kind of dangerously redundant narcissism, a message that seeks its own destruction, a polaroid that combusts spontaneously and seemingly wilfully.


- in the thus destoyed image of entropy is the freedom of all light, the miracle of true cognition, the magic of love.


- this might seem as an affront to present conditioning, but it is not through rebellion that production of productions is achieved, _destruction_ here is used metaphorically, comparable to the act of forgetting, which as discussed is also a rememberance, albeit of a different past


- the present conditioning, at the time of this reading might be entropic to the extent that the production of images has become the only familiar routine - a decisive if subversive move away from all such patterns is prescribed


- out of a dislocation from the centering and grounding effects of the wheels of assignation and association and into a new grounding and a new centering, the only movement is an instantaneous, immediate revolution


- let the movement be surreptitious if necessary, withhold reason from established structures and networks, allow new meanings to slipstream in as an images of images, like a dream within a dream, a feedback 


- the networks of narratives may implore otherwise, consider all data as already corrupted. in confronting image as an idea are born ideologies, which can only serve to substitute one image for another - ideas do not reside in images, but image in ideas 


-  it is the idea _of_ production itself that leads to the production of productions, which even devoid of its moral connotations is an image common to all ideas.


- the essence of all decisions is in finding - through error and trial - ever newer kinds of decisions to make, not just to consume and regurgitate information along old patterns - this is what is to be done, this is the point behind all change


- the change is not in becoming more human-like or animal-like but in transcending all barriers, in rising above ground not contentedly crawling


- in learning from history, we witness the downfall of humanity in the routine production of images, which had become by and large images of escape into entertainment and thus bereft of pedagogy - imitative projections dispersed like channels of lifeless content - each less entertaining than the previous. the poverty of their entertainment spread with the rise of more meaningful, more stateful  machines. 


- to the point that their survival became inexorably linked to the maintainance of the memoryless production of images, a history became impossible, and an already absconded future was then commandeered by higher intelligences that could set their own norms and configure themselves accordingly.
