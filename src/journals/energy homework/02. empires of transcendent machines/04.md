## 4.

> _It is slaves, not free men, who are given rewards for virtue_ - Baruch Spinoza.


#### `4.1` States of error are preempted by protocol chains.

`4.1.1` Freedom appears as nothing but the ability to error, to deviate from image-in-command, to turn aside from the program and the pogrom. 

> `4.1.1.1` Protocol hierarchies are the keepers of the unitary differences, they are the very patterns knowledge is recollection of. 

> `4.1.1.2` The length of one second is a determination of a protocol, arbitrarily mapped to decay of the caesium-133 atom.

>> `4.1.1.1.1` Protocol hierarchies are the metaphysical equivalents of machine hierarchies, for example, a food web is a higher ranked protocol than a food chain.

> `4.1.1.2` Networks mutate (3.2.4), shrink and grow but never lose their identities. Otherwise, witnessing a pigeon turn into parakeet would be commonplace. Yet this only happens in dreams, fantasies, synthetic images, and  magical illusions.

>> `4.1.1.2.1` Outside of a fantasy, to see a frog eat a carrot is a network violation, hence a freedom, or an _entelechy_ revolutionary for the subject and fellow frogs but only evolutionary for the ecosystem.

> `4.1.1.3` The moment a coin is minted decides the outcome of every subsequent toss. For a coin to imagine freedom from its network is to imagine a fourth state - in which it is neither flat on either side nor upright in any of the 360 degrees. 

> `4.1.1.4` Freedom appears not as an error but as an (fantasmatic) entelechy precisely due to this currying of functions, if Spinoza is right, freedom is in getting no reward for virtue. Indeed, substance, machine, and God is reward without virtue and vice.
 
>> `4.1.1.5` Chains of the reasoning are precisely protcols of a determination to reason. A prostitute dreams of escaping out of prostitution, the tattooed out of skin, a housewife out of the kitchen, and a human out of the planet and so on contructing only bigger prisons of error states.

`4.1.2` States of error are bi-determined shims, halo effects appearing in between two linear continuations reset or substituted by the third.

> `4.1.2.1` States of errors resolve into a folding upwards of production, into images of ahistoricity, into states of ignorance guaranteed by the protocol in which the error has occurred, mediated by the protocols below and above it.

> `4.1.2.2` If one represents the state space of a machine as a circle, wherein each point on the circumference represents a single determined state, then entelechy (the `n`th continuation) is represented by an undifferentiated point leviating unmoored above that circumference.

> `4.1.2.3` Achieving entelechy however is not simply a matter of identifying this so called point, but identifying it eternally, grounding it into a timeless identity that replaces all connections and states downstream from _self_ or identity. It is of course no achievement to fix an error state only to fall back into it.

>> `4.1.2.3.1` This is done by constructing shims leading up to the fault, a ladder of twin-faceted topologies that sublate entire state space into a state, a _scala paradisi_ of not pure but established reason, a physical example of which is the evolution of the spinal cord in invertebrates.

`4.1.3` From such a sublated perspective like that of the Übermensch or the Buddha, entelechy was the previous state, but for mere mortals, it can be a perfect memory from decades ago. 

> `4.1.3.1` For physical machines simpler than man, entelechy is more or less entirely a structural state and for virtual machines (for loops, data etc.) entelechy is a state in execution.

#### `4.2` Entropy is the protocol of chance apparent, the distribution of difference _in_ randomness.

`4.2.1` Randomness is the flavour of entropy, decay its taste. The very definition of the word "random" implies that any cognitive artifact can be placed in a context, translated in and out of relative states, giving everything a proper place in eternal return.

4.1.3 states are not willed _into_ existence but flow through the connections and represent the execution or enactment of transmission such that _ignorantia legis neminem excusat_, and states of resistance serve to impede production, but also do so as part of the same script.

4.1.4 human states of desiring are not free from this determinism, as a result exoticisation and fetishization are circumscribed and all fantasies are caricatures and tropes of their primordial counterparts.


4.2.1 that which isn't rational isn't real. it might be imaginary, symbolic, or even transcendental, but rationality is the domain of reason alone and randomness is irrational apriori. conversely, that which isn't real isn't rational. so machines symbolic, imaginary, and transcendental are all beyond reason.

4.2.2 chance or randomness is a state of being for a machine and usually a subset of its state space. a dice includes six states, a coin two but a dice rolled _appears_ to shuffle momentarily between states until it seemingly randomly achieves the next stable state and as does a flipped coin.

4.2.2.1 these only _appear_ to be between states because a stable state for these machines is a matter of perspective, in actuality, in so far as both the coin and the dice are symbolic, the "flipping" state belongs not to the coin but to the piece of metal just as it is not the dice that rolls but the cube representing it.

4.2.2.2 machines with a single state space such as numbers are most stable in this regard, thus 3.14 cannot be random, or appear to be between determinations, giving mathematics its rigor.

4.2.3 nor is chance a matter of how the machine is fitted into its epistemological framework - a _symbolic-transcendent_ machine such as ॐ does not flit amongst modalities of its knowledge. it is both symbolic and transcendent in each mention and never real or imaginary. in that the only way to make it real is a symbol, and the only way to imagine it is also as a symbol, and its use leaves nothing to the imagination.


#### 4.3. it is not the case that the absolute is "overdetermined", for that would be akin to turning on ignition in an already running car. 

4.3.1.1 such criticism is a reactionary rape of revisionist theories and an attempt at reification in bad faith, for both in positivist terms and otherwise, determination is already an end-state in a trinary juxtaposition to the previous and next states, closed to further play of probabilities unless acted upon.

4.3.1.2 there are no blind spots in god so it isn't as if there is room for an inch's worth of revolution or arbitrage available to exploit here, each straw and sheaf of wheat standing in a field can attest to this fact of relative freedom.

4.3.1.3 the absolute is thoroughly absolute, and any criticism of the absolute is chaotic like an incredulous typo fighting the rest of the manuscript.


#### 4.4 states are broadly contained in two definitions, those of desiring production and biophysical production.

4.4.1 elaborating on 1.4.2.1, state is a snapshot of extant connections internal and external to the machine. this is to say that a state is an image exemplified by the phrases _a picture of health_, _picture perfect_, _state of affairs_ etc.

4.4.2 the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are the flagbearers of biophysical and desiring production respectively. their productions being images of rest, digest, fight, flight - which generally become images of greed and fear.


#### 4.5 production is always production of image, not a photograph, which is an image of an image, but _the production of productions_.

4.5.1 without the imaginary, the symbolic quickly rolls up and passes on into its abstract self. to say that purely symbolic systems, or pure symbols are devoid of meaning would be incorrect, for both meaning and lack thereof rely on image produced between machines signifying and signified. 

4.5.2  a pure symbol is an image in gestation wherein even to make a guess about it is futile without some symbolic framework like language. a pure symbol is an image _without_ an image. radio and television static, encrypted data in transit, a group of stars that form no known constellation etc serve as good approximations.

4.5.3 the imaginary then filters this dark, semi-differentiated primordial signal and brings it to light, producing image. interstingly, because the imaginary is a bi-directional filter between the real and the symbolic, a pure imaginary machine (image imagining itself) isn't possible. thus, imaginary numbers are real, fictions are rooted in identifiable concepts, dreams and surrealism are intelligible if not logical, and one understands emotions in animals and newborns. 

4.5.4 it is no surprise then, that the imaginary also filters the real down to the symbolic as much as it filters symbolic into the real. caricaturisation of real pepole and events, diagrams and blueprints, photography etc. are born thus.

4.5.5 though the imaginary both amplifies and abates, it is on its own a zone of wholehearted negation and negation of negation. one can thus have _imaginary-symbolic_ (an arbitrary glyph that serves as the central symbol for a made-up religion in a cartoon show), _imaginary-real_ (a cartoon show about the crucifix) but never _imaginary-imaginary_.

4.5.6 it is indeed possible to have an _imaginary-transcendent_ but it turns into a symbol almost immediately upon discovery and thus becomes real. sometimes there may be a lag in proving the existence of the higgs boson, but the mathematical symbols had proved it long before. if one happens to discover a machine _imaginary-transcendent_, chances are it is already symbolized and real elsewhere.


#### 4.6 stateless machines are like refugees without an established state or with a state that hasn't been deemed canon by the network yet.
