> _I have been dealing for many years with certain structures within animal brains that seemed to be interpretable as pieces of computing machinery because of their simplicity and/or regularity. Much of this work is only interesting if you are yourself involved in it. At times, though, in the back of my mind, while I was counting fibers in the visual ganglia of the fly or synapses in the cerebral cortex of the mouse, I felt knots untie, distinctions dissolve, difficulties disappear, difficulties I had experienced much earlier when I still held my first naive philosophical approach to the problem of the mind._ - Valentino Braitenberg, Vehicles

#### `1.1` Trascendent machines are metaphysical organs of the infrastructure of eternal return. 

`1.1.2` See `2.2` for a precise definition of a machine.

`1.1.3` Trancendence is a qualia without a quanta. It is a light which is neither wave, nor particle; not both, nor either. Instead it is the very composition and decomposition of information relating to it.


#### `1.2` Eternal return is thus the ultimate machine constituted by machines which are not transcendent, those that are, and relationships amongst them.

`1.2.1` A crude analogy for it could be that of a sanctum sanctorum in a temple, wherein one or several idols placed in it would then represent the infrastructure thereof.

`1.2.2` Eternal return is that which is always already returning, in contrast to _temporal_ return, or that which returns on repression, forgetting, and in the memory of time. Eternal return is _time out of mind_, where both time and mind are machines in it.


#### `1.3` In this _mÃ©taphysique libertine_, the sum of machines, their connections and states is also a transcendent machine - revealing thus a hierarchical network which extends in the _nah und fern_.

`1.3.1` All machines thus exist in hierarchies and inhabit in and as states of other machines.

`1.3.2` Machines exist in a finite field of states and connections, wherein state transitions are relayed inter alia.

> `1.3.2.1` States are simply descriptive data on extant machine, a state is a unit of feedback broadcasting a machine's conditions, environment, health etc.

>> `1.3.2.1.1` Individual states are not machines but collectively they transform into infinite and finite _state machines_. 

> `1.3.2.2` Connections are interfaces or "relations" within and without machines.

>> `1.3.2.2.1` Unlike states, a connection can be a machine i.e. a connecting machine such as a bridge, strait, or isthmus.

>> `1.3.2.2.2` Connections can inhere in states, lie dormant and get activated upon certain changes in state.
