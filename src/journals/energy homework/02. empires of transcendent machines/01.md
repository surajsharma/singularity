> _I have been dealing for many years with certain structures within animal brains that seemed to be interpretable as pieces of computing machinery because of their simplicity and/or regularity. Much of this work is only interesting if you are yourself involved in it. At times, though, in the back of my mind, while I was counting fibers in the visual ganglia of the fly or synapses in the cerebral cortex of the mouse, I felt knots untie, distinctions dissolve, difficulties disappear, difficulties I had experienced much earlier when I still held my first naive philosophical approach to the problem of the mind._ - Valentino Braitenberg, Vehicles

#### `1.1` Transcendent machines are metaphysical organs of the infrastructure of eternal return. 

`1.1.1` The summum bonum of pure reason, transcendence is the metaphysical superlative of efficiency and efficacy, the drive towards which is an _entelechy_.

> `1.1.1.1` Transcendence is the territory for which the observed is a map. It is a qualia without a quanta. 

> `1.1.1.2` It is the image of all light, or the stereogrammatic map of light. Neither wave, nor particle; not both, nor either.

> `1.1.1.3` It is the very composition and decomposition of information relating to itself. 

`1.1.2` See `2.2` for a precise definition of a machine.


#### `1.2` This _mÃ©taphysique libertine_ is a pre-socratic fire pit, from which rises the smoke of a mechanistic monism that envelopes this self-consuming enquiry. 

`1.2.1` The universal is a machine, as is the particular. 

`1.2.2` The enumerable and the unenumerable are machines. 

> `1.2.2.1` Singualrity is a machine, so is duality, trinity, and everything that follows. 

> `1.2.2.2` Zero is a transcendental machine.

`1.2.3` The sum of two machines is one machine, the difference between them is another.

`1.2.4` Mind and body are machines, as is the soul - observer, observed, and cognition its workers.

`1.2.5` Not to say that almost everything is a machine, but even the word 'almost' seems to tick away as if a gear inside an alarm clock called 'everything'. Tick, tick, tick... the machinery of narrative, not the other way around.

> `1.2.5.1` Our disavowal need be thorough for the sake of reflective, symmetric, and transitive equivalence, so nothing is also a machine. Both literally as in empty space and vacuum, but also figuratively as in a lack of an image.


#### `1.3` Eternal return is interpreted as the ultimate machine constituted by machines which are not transcendent, those that are, and relationships amongst them.

`1.3.1` A crude analogy for it could be that of a sanctum sanctorum in a temple, wherein one or several idols placed in it would then represent the infrastructure thereof.

`1.3.2` Eternal return is that which is always already returning, in contrast to _temporal_ return, or that which returns on repression, forgetting, and in the memory of time. 

`1.3.3` Eternal return is _time out of mind_, where both time and mind are machines in it.
