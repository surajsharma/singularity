> _I have been dealing for many years with certain structures within animal brains that seemed to be interpretable as pieces of computing machinery because of their simplicity and/or regularity. Much of this work is only interesting if you are yourself involved in it. At times, though, in the back of my mind, while I was counting fibers in the visual ganglia of the fly or synapses in the cerebral cortex of the mouse, I felt knots untie, distinctions dissolve, difficulties disappear, difficulties I had experienced much earlier when I still held my first naive philosophical approach to the problem of the mind._ - Valentino Braitenberg, Vehicles

#### `1.1` Transcendent machines are metaphysical organs of the infrastructure of eternal return. 

`1.1.2` See `2.2` for a precise definition of a machine.

`1.1.3` Transcendence is the territory to which the observed is a map. It is a qualia without a quanta. It is a light which is neither wave, nor particle; not both, nor either. Instead it is the very composition and decomposition of information relating to itself. 

`1.1.3.1` The summum bonum of pure reason, transcendence is the metaphysical superlative of efficiency and efficacy, the drive towards which is an _entelechy_.

#### `1.2` In this _m√©taphysique libertine_ of pre-socratic persuasion, a mechanistic monism envelopes the enquiry. 

`1.3.1` The universal is a machine, as is the particular. 

`1.3.2` The enumerable and the unenumerable are machines. Singualrity is a machine, so is duality, trinity, and everything that follows.

`1.3.3` The sum of two machines is one machine, the difference between them is another.

`1.3.4` Mind and body are machines, as is the soul - observer, observed, and cognition its workers.

`1.3.5` Not to say that almost everything is a machine, but even the word 'almost' seems to tick away as if a gear inside an alarm clock called 'everything'. Tick, tick, tick... 


#### `1.3` Eternal return is interpreted as the ultimate machine constituted by machines which are not transcendent, those that are, and relationships amongst them.

`1.3.1` A crude analogy for it could be that of a sanctum sanctorum in a temple, wherein one or several idols placed in it would then represent the infrastructure thereof.

`1.3.2` Eternal return is that which is always already returning, in contrast to _temporal_ return, or that which returns on repression, forgetting, and in the memory of time. Eternal return is _time out of mind_, where both time and mind are machines in it.
