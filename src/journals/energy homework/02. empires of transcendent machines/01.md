> _I have been dealing for many years with certain structures within animal brains that seemed to be interpretable as pieces of computing machinery because of their simplicity and/or regularity. Much of this work is only interesting if you are yourself involved in it. At times, though, in the back of my mind, while I was counting fibers in the visual ganglia of the fly or synapses in the cerebral cortex of the mouse, I felt knots untie, distinctions dissolve, difficulties disappear, difficulties I had experienced much earlier when I still held my first naive philosophical approach to the problem of the mind._ - Valentino Braitenberg, Vehicles

#### 1.1 Trascendent machines are metaphysical organs of the infrastructure of eternal return. 


#### 1.2 Eternal return is constituted by machines which are not transcendent (space, matter, substance...), those that are (time, vacuum, style...), and the interconnections or relations amongst them.

1.2.1 eternal return is that which is always already returning, in contrast to _temporal_ return, or that which returns on repression, forgetting, and in the memory of time. eternal return is _time out of mind_, where both time and mind are machines in it.

1.2.2 a crude analogy for it could be that of a sanctum sanctorum in a temple, wherein one or several idols placed in it would then represent the infrastructure thereof 


#### 1.3 relations here include both _inter_ and _intra_ connections - which connect transcendent machines to each other and to themselves respectively.

1.3.1 connections are _a-transcendent_ ordinarily and rarely otherwise

1.3.2 connection called _self_ (identity) is not _a-transcendent_, as are other more temporal relations like filiality and familiarity

1.3.3 any connection includes the probability of transcendence 


#### 1.4 in this _m√©taphysique libertine_, the sum of machines, their connections and states is also a transcendent machine - revealing thus a hierarchical network which extends in the _nah und fern_, pervading all consciousness.

1.4.1 all machines thus exist in hierarchies and inhabit in and as states of other machines

1.4.2 all machines exist in a finite field of states and connections, wherein state transitions are relayed inter alia

1.4.2.1 states are simply descriptive data on extant machine, a state is a unit of feedback about machine's conditions, environment, health etc.

1.4.2.2 states are not machines in themselves but there exist finite and infinite _state machines_ which are nothing more than a finite or infinite collection of states.
