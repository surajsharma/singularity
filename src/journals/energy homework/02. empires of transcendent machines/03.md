#### `3.1` The "mesh and lace" of machinery produces a network seemingly indestructible and pervasive.

`3.1.1`  A machine unconnected from others is unteneable for the same reasons a machine without feedback (or a 'private language') is illogical (see 2.5.1), even fictional apparatus is connected to the humdrum of the real via the parallax of symbolic and imaginary. 

> `3.1.1.1` Localised configurations of network are pronounced in _micro-networks_, shadowed in microclimates, biomes etc. 

> `3.1.1.2` A machine can be transferred from one micro-network (organ, tribe, assembly etc.) to another (jail, hospital, cubicle, chassis etc.), but never moved out of the macro-network, this is the metaphysical counterpart to the law of conservation of energy.

> `3.1.1.3` Machines isolated from its micro-network, like an isolated neuron, quickly transcend their functional boundaries, often leaving behind only structural ruins serving  historical functions.

> `3.1.1.4` Every quark, blade of grass, and drop of ocean is eternally networked. Even in states of error or retirement, it is never truly disenfranchised royally enough, never out of feedback.

`3.1.2` The network is not just the abstraction apparent but also the _unterschied_ that is its shadow, the _matrix_ episteme apriori in which epistemological modes first sprout.
