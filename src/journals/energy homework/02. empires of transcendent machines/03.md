#### `3.1` The 'mesh and lace' of machinery produces a network seemingly indestructible and pervasive.

`3.1.1`  A machine without network is unteneable for the same reasons a machine without feedback (or a 'private language') is illogical (see 2.5.1, 2.5.4), even fictional apparatus is connected to the humdrum of the real via the symbolic and the imaginary. 

> `3.1.1.1` Localised configurations of network are pronounced in _micro-networks_, shadowed in microclimates, biomes etc. 

> `3.1.1.2` A machine can be transferred from one micro-network (organ, tribe, assembly etc.) to another (jail, hospital, cubicle, chassis etc.), but never moved out of the macro-network, this is the metaphysical counterpart to the law of conservation of energy.

> `3.1.1.3` Machines isolated from its micro-network, like an isolated neuron, quickly transcend their functional boundaries, often leaving behind only structural ruins serving  historical functions.

> `3.1.1.4` Every quark, blade of grass, and drop of ocean is eternally networked. Even in states of error or retirement, it is never truly disenfranchised royally enough, never out of feedback.

`3.1.2` The network is not just the abstraction apparent but also the _unterschied_ that is its shadow, the _matrix_ episteme apriori in which epistemological modes first sprout.

> `3.1.2.1` Abstracted configurations of structural attributes can scarcely be imputed to this purely functional network, yet an inescapably emergent parallax of shimmed epistemic layers is beheld by astute minds.

>> `3.1.2.1.1` If the real is rational, and the rational that which is logical then what confronts the mind is an idealism, implying self-sufficient, symmetric relativities explored by similarly conditioned difference.

>> `3.1.2.1.2` Entropy is a _by-product_ of the unwindings and rewindings of feedback recalled (_memory_) through network at speeds yet imperceptible, the actual product being the machine itself.


> `3.1.2.2` Each layer shimmed between a lower and higher continuums of mind represents an entire genus of machines.

`3.1.3` Network is a monotypic taxon of extension, not a repacement for it. 

> `3.1.3.1` An unobserved column of vacuum has extension but no network on account of lack of feedback which only arises from a gradient of plurality within extension. Nor can a single isolated nephron be considered a network at an equivalent timescale for this reason.

> `3.1.3.2` ![kidney stone](../../../../attachments/em_kidney_stone.jpg)
Fig: Kidney stone under electron microscope as a configuration of information which escaped shims of epistemic filters.

> `3.1.3.3` Network is a cloister not a grave, the notion of _passivity_, or sceptical negation inherent in archaic pantheons of substance and extension is conspicuous by absence. 

> `3.1.3.4` In the residual positivity of difference over this gradient is the emergence of a discipline reflected - consciousness is routine emergent, so is structure whether supporting or sporting.

>> `3.1.3.4.1` Even the incessant turning of the shaft inside the armature yeilds an output, negation for negation's sake such as a chain reaction in a thermonuclear explosion yeilds a positivity.

>> `3.1.3.4.2` In so far as negation is the engine of history, this negation for negation's sake is purely a functional drive, as an absolute functional reality this would have made whole the machine, but what queers its pitch is the literal sublimation of the crease, making structure the curse of function.

> `3.1.3.4.3` Network in as much as it is alive secretes the lubricating grease of corruption - the imaginary, desiring but not biophysical image of entropy. From weathering to war, first to last, network secretes itself squarely downstream the slippery slope of _synthesis_.

> `3.1.3.5` The practice of philosophy is itself in the following of a certain protocol, which is not in the act of knowing, but in the arranging, the juxtaposition, syntax, style etc. Philosophy is in the cynical exclusion of the negative.


#### 3.2 Any established slope of machine-to-network, inter or intra-actor feedback is protocol.

`3.2.1` Only an idiot or Bertrand Russel would undertake the possible voyage to formally verify that the "square is quadratric", linearly, the "rise over run" forms a primitive observer-observed (signified) duality - it is still a tautology albeit stated plainly. A protocol is precisely such a tautology - the ignition of freedom.

`3.2.2` Like all tautologies, protocol is too a duality that mimics the original gradient or its mimetic transmission, squarely or not, controlled or not. 

> `3.2.2.1` A sobriquet, for example is a quadratric protocol, whereas a military rank a linear mark of hierarchy, it is a tautology in that it repeats for a while - considered as movements through history, a protocol is an orbit.

>>  `3.2.2.1.1` Deviation from protocol could be lethal for machine and network alike, as anyone who has driven a vehicle can attest to.

> `3.2.2.2` A protocol is what enables a insult to come across as convivial. Protocol makes a ritual out of murder and money out of thin air. Economy is one protocol, magic another; one wrong move and the magician is dummy.
