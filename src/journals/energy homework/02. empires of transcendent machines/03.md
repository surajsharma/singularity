#### `3.1` The 'mesh and lace' of machinery produces a network seemingly indestructible and pervasive.

`3.1.1`  A machine without network is unteneable for the same reasons a machine without feedback (or a 'private language') is illogical (see 2.5.1, 2.5.4), even fictional apparatus is connected to the humdrum of the real via the symbolic and the imaginary. 

> `3.1.1.1` Localised configurations of network are pronounced in _micro-networks_, shadowed in microclimates, biomes etc. 

> `3.1.1.2` A machine can be transferred from one micro-network (organ, tribe, assembly etc.) to another (jail, hospital, cubicle, chassis etc.), but never moved out of the macro-network, this is the metaphysical counterpart to the law of conservation of energy.

> `3.1.1.3` Machines isolated from its micro-network, like an isolated neuron, quickly transcend their functional boundaries, often leaving behind only structural ruins serving  historical functions.

> `3.1.1.4` Every quark, blade of grass, and drop of ocean is eternally networked. Even in states of error or retirement, it is never truly disenfranchised royally enough, never out of feedback.

`3.1.2` The network is not just the abstraction apparent but also the _unterschied_ that is its shadow, the _matrix_ episteme apriori in which epistemological modes first sprout.

> `3.1.2.1` Abstracted configurations of structural attributes can scarcely be imputed to this purely functional network, yet an inescapably emergent parallax of shimmed epistemic layers is beheld by astute minds.

>> `3.1.2.1.1` If the real is rational, and the rational that which is logical then what confronts the mind is an idealism, implying self-sufficient, symmetric relativities explored by similarly conditioned difference.

>> `3.1.2.1.2` Entropy is a by-product of the unwindings and rewindings of feedback recalled (_memory_) through this network at speeds yet imperceptible, the actual product being the machine itself.

> `3.1.2.2` Each layer shimmed between a lower and higher continuum of mind represents an entire genus of machines.

`3.1.3` Network is a monotypic taxon of extension, not a repacement for it. An unobsrved column of vacuum has extension but no network on account of lack of feedback which only arises from a gradient over descending diversity in extension.
