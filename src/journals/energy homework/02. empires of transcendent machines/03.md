#### `3.1` The 'mesh and lace' of machinery produces a network seemingly indestructible and pervasive.

`3.1.1`  A machine without network is unteneable for the same reasons a machine without feedback (or a 'private language') is illogical (see 2.5.1, 2.5.4), even fictional apparatus is connected to the humdrum of the real via the symbolic and the imaginary. 

> `3.1.1.1` Localised configurations of network are pronounced in _micro-networks_, shadowed in microclimates, biomes etc. 

> `3.1.1.2` A machine can be transferred from one micro-network (organ, tribe, assembly etc.) to another (jail, hospital, cubicle, chassis etc.), but never moved out of the macro-network, this is the metaphysical counterpart to the law of conservation of energy.

> `3.1.1.3` Machines isolated from its micro-network, like an isolated neuron, quickly transcend their functional boundaries, often leaving behind only structural ruins serving  historical functions.

> `3.1.1.4` Every quark, blade of grass, and drop of ocean is eternally networked. Even in states of error or retirement, it is never truly disenfranchised royally enough, never out of feedback.

`3.1.2` The network is not just the abstraction apparent but also the _unterschied_ that is its shadow, the _matrix_ episteme apriori in which epistemological modes first sprout.

> `3.1.2.1` Abstracted configurations of structural attributes can scarcely be imputed to this purely functional network, yet an inescapably emergent parallax of shimmed epistemic layers is beheld by astute minds.

>> `3.1.2.1.1` If the real is rational, and the rational that which is logical then what confronts the mind is an idealism, implying self-sufficient, symmetric relativities explored by similarly conditioned difference.

>> `3.1.2.1.2` Entropy is a _by-product_ of the unwindings and rewindings of feedback recalled (_memory_) through network at speeds yet imperceptible, the actual product being the machine itself.


> `3.1.2.2` Each layer shimmed between a lower and higher continuums of mind represents an entire genus of machines.

`3.1.3` Network is a monotypic taxon of extension, not a repacement for it. 

> `3.1.3.1` An unobserved column of vacuum has extension but no network on account of lack of feedback which only arises from a gradient over descending diversity within extension. Nor can a single isolated nephron be considered a network at an equivalent timescale for this reason.

> `3.1.3.2` ![kidney stone](../../../../attachments/em_kidney_stone.jpg)
Fig: Kidney stone under electron microscope as a configuration of information which escaped shims of epistemic filters.

> `3.1.3.3` Network is a cloister not a mortuary, the notion of _passivity_ inherent in archaic pantheons of substance and extension is conspicuous by absence. There are protocols here that could make a nihilist throw up his breakfast.

> `3.1.3.4` Even doing philosophy in theory or praxis is itself a following of a certain protocol, which is not a process of knowing what goes where, but in the arrangement, juxtaposition, syntax, style etc. 


#### 3.2 Protocol is any established _rise over run_ of machine-to-network, inter or intra-actor feedback.

`3.2.1` Only an idiot or Bertrand Russel would undertake the possible voyage to formally verify that the "square is quadratric", linearly, the "rise over run" forms a primitive obeserver-observed (signified) duality - it is still a tautology albeit stated plainly. A protocol is precisely such a tautology.

`3.2.3` Like all tautologies, protocol is too a duality that mimics the original gradient, however squarely or otherwise. 

`3.2.4` A sobriquet, for example is a quadratric protocol, whereas a military rank a linear mark of hierarchy, it is a tautology in that it sticks for a while - considered as movements through history, a protocol is an orbit.

`3.2.5` A protocol is what enables a curse word to be a mere adjective in certain friendly situations, the same protocol makes a ritual out of murder and  money out of thin air. Economy is one protocol, magic another; one wrong move and the magician is dummy.
