> _It is considered folly to imagine any freedom._ - Martin Buber

#### `3.1` Machinery produces a network seemingly indestructible and pervasive.

`3.1.1`  A machine without network is unteneable for the same reasons a machine without feedback (or a 'private language') is illogical (see 2.5.1, 2.5.4), even fictional apparatus is connected to the humdrum of the real via the symbolic and the imaginary. 

> `3.1.1.1` Localised configurations of network are pronounced in _micro-networks_, shadowed in microclimates, biomes etc. 

> `3.1.1.2` A machine can be transferred from one micro-network (organ, tribe, assembly etc.) to another (jail, hospital, cubicle, chassis etc.), but never moved out of the macro-network, this is the metaphysical counterpart to the law of conservation of energy.

> `3.1.1.3` Machines isolated from its micro-network, like an isolated neuron, quickly transcend their functional boundaries, often leaving behind only structural ruins serving  historical functions.

> `3.1.1.4` Every quark, blade of grass, and drop of ocean is eternally networked. Even in states of error or retirement, it is never truly disenfranchised royally enough, never out of feedback.

`3.1.2` The network is not just the abstraction apparent but also the _unterschied_ that is its shadow, the _matrix_ episteme apriori in which epistemological modes first sprout.

> `3.1.2.1` Abstracted configurations of structural attributes can scarcely be imputed to this purely functional network, yet an inescapably emergent parallax of shimmed epistemic layers is beheld by astute minds.

>> `3.1.2.1.1` If the real is rational, and the rational that which is logical then what confronts the mind is an idealism, implying self-sufficient, symmetric relativities explored by similarly conditioned difference.

>> `3.1.2.1.2` Entropy is a _by-product_ of the unwindings and rewindings of feedback recalled (_memory_) through network at speeds yet imperceptible, the actual product being the machine itself.


> `3.1.2.2` Each layer shimmed between a lower and higher continuums of mind represents an entire genus of machines.

`3.1.3` Network is a monotypic taxon of extension, not a repacement for it. 

> `3.1.3.1` An unobserved column of vacuum has extension but no network on account of lack of feedback which only arises from a gradient of plurality within extension. Nor can a single isolated nephron be considered a network at an equivalent timescale for this reason.

> `3.1.3.2` ![kidney stone](../../../../attachments/em_kidney_stone.jpg)
Fig: Kidney stone under electron microscope as a configuration of information which escaped shims of epistemic filters.

> `3.1.3.3` Network is a cloister not a grave, the notion of _passivity_, or sceptical negation inherent in archaic pantheons of substance and extension is conspicuous by absence. 

> `3.1.3.4` In the residual positivity of difference over this gradient is the emergence of a discipline reflected - consciousness is routine emergent, so is structure whether supporting or sporting.

>> `3.1.3.4.1` Even the incessant turning of the shaft inside the armature yields an output, negation for negation's sake such as a chain reaction in a thermonuclear explosion yields a positivity.

>> `3.1.3.4.2` In so far as negation is the engine of history, this negation for negation's sake is purely a functional drive, as an absolute functional reality this would have made whole the machine, but what queers its pitch is the literal sublimation of the crease, making structure the curse of function.

> `3.1.3.5` Network in as much as it is alive secretes the lubricating grease of corruption - the imaginary, desiring but not biophysical image of entropy. From weathering to war, first to last, network flows squarely downstream the slippery slope of _synthesis_.

> `3.1.3.6` The practice of philosophy is itself in the following of a certain protocol, which is not in the act of knowing, but in the arranging, the juxtaposition, syntax, style etc. Philosophy is in the cynical exclusion of the negative.


#### 3.2 Any established slope of feedback is protocol.

`3.2.1` Only an idiot or Bertrand Russel would undertake the possible voyage to formally verify that the "square is quadratric", linearly however, the "rise over run" forms a primitive observer-observed (signified) dualism.

> `3.2.1.1` The two roots of the equation comprise a tautology. A protocol is precisely such a tautology - the ignition of freedom.

`3.2.2` Like all tautologies, protocol too is a duality that mimics the original gradient or its mimetic transmission, squarely or not, controlled or not. 

> `3.2.2.1` A sobriquet, for example is a quadratric protocol, whereas a military rank a linear mark of hierarchy, it is a tautology in that it repeats for a while - considered as movements through history, a protocol is an orbit.

>>  `3.2.2.1.1` Deviation from protocol could be lethal for machine and network alike, as anyone who has driven a vehicle can attest to.

> `3.2.2.2` A protocol is what enables a insult to come across as convivial. Protocol makes a ritual out of murder and money out of thin air. Economy is one protocol, magic another; one wrong move and the magician is dummy.

`3.2.3` A river basin is a tautology, a binary logos within which run all binary pathologies of networked potential. 

> `3.2.3.1` This inseparability of morphology and physiology is the birth of network. The medium can be separated from the message no more than time can be vaporised out of narrative.

`3.2.4` Protocols can make the network shrink or grow in due course.

> `3.2.4.1` Another point of marked departure from interpretations of substance and extention is in the bi-directional propulsion and promulgation of network, unlike the passivity of substance, networks in feedback are alive and can renovate themselves.

> `3.2.4.2` These self-destructive functional drives that form pathos cannot be discounted by any emancipatory logos, for chimpanzees have 13 sets of ribs but humans 12.

> `3.2.4.3` The self-organising organ that is network continually prunes extra addresses of representation and trims the roles of mechanisms within and without observer, regenerating and reconfiguring itself each step of the way.

> `3.2.4.3.1` Metastatic growths, rusting and corrosion, wearing-and-tearing etc. form part of this protocol of eternal renewal.

`3.2.5` Hierarchically, the network forms the downstream subdivisions of declinations, declensions, inclinations, and intentions of difference.

> `3.2.5.1` These subdivisions create and occupy the rooms of language and meaning. A tree might be a pathology, but the word "tree" is also a morphology - herein lies the extension of word, the innards of the machine called language and the semi-permeable membranes of its protocol - meaning.

> `3.2.5.2` The emergent function of language thus could well be the creation of space, or structure. The universe is being made and unmade not on the fringes of reason as Kant thought but at its localised center - which is a plurality.

> `3.2.5.3` In so far as language itself is an unmoored network of meaning, in which any subnet is defined only by the virtue of its internal connections, it is prudent to discern this connectedness as an _assignation_ of integrity to the nebulousness of the otherwise inexpressible and chaotic network.


#### 3.3 Connections in a network assign state to structure.

`3.3.1` It is a solipsism to say that "information consumes attention", for attention itself is information. In objective paradigms, consumptions and excretions become instantiated redundancies.

> `3.3.1.1` Machines consume and excrete machines, networks consume and excrete networks, protocols do the same to protocols. Food chains, cultures, civilizations, and empires all proliferate in orders of self-replicating, and self-destructing tendencies of difference.

> `3.3.1.2` The story of connections starts and ends in this primary self referentiality afforded by network to machine. 

> `3.3.1.3` The first assignation by network, as a matter of protocol of protocols, is a label of containment - a _ligne claire_ excluding the sprite from the background.

> `3.3.1.4` The fundamental connection called self is at once a configuration, a feedback channel, and a feedback - a closed triumverate of logos, pathos, and ethos folded as embeddings of structural functional dualisms.

`3.3.2` The self connection is a dizzying circularity the linear exculpation of which is the preferable past time of evolution and devolution.

> `3.3.2.1` Contrary to populist beliefs self is not an intance of will or power, but the throughput of network, the network excercises itself _through_ self, not _in_ it.

> `3.3.2.2` What is _within_ self is more self, connected all the way to configurations not _pre_-determined, but _para_-determined, or simply determined - a certitude discerned locally as the illusion known as "free will".

>> `3.3.2.2.1` The rallying cry of tired machinery is always "give me liberty or give me death", but there is no escaping the network, even death is mere reappropriation of states, a reconnection transcendent. As a result of this malfunctioning of identity, one receives neither.

`3.3.3` What is without self is a proctored field affording six degrees of separation in `n` dimensions.

> `3.3.3.1` The antidistributivity of identity offers itself up to the concomitant delta of feedback, flows into the myriad channels of its own ironic enumeration, discharges into an infinite, unproducable silence determined.

`3.3.4` A less ideal self-assimilation happens in production _proper_, in the meeting of destination with source inside echos distant still. In relations familal amd familiar, which ostensibly are nothing but outreach.

`3.3.4.1` Here instead of discharging into silence, information is noisily sluiced into the other (machine), through the other's orifices of acceptable compromises and ports of lack, in exchange of self-similar confirmations of extant folds and biases, the eternal commerce of desire and consequences.

`3.3.4.2` Offices of production proper are subnets of opaque beauracracies in which consumption and self-consumption are frequently the only patterns of attention. 

> `3.3.4.2.1` Occasionally (war, natural disasters, industrial sabotage, political intrusions) these subnets produce corruption almost exclusively (see 3.1.3.5) but usually there is a "surplus" of cleaner production.

`3.3.4.3` Under idyllic conditions, the connection is transparent, assigning longevity to the networked entities instead of entropic debt, guilt, and neglect.

> `3.3.4.3.1` Transparency here implies a clearer intention of the observer towards production, not a theatrical disclosure of "truth" but a conservative estimate of the requirements of production - not using a pen where a pencil suffices and so on.

#### 3.4 Identity is a transcendent connection already constituted by and for the network
