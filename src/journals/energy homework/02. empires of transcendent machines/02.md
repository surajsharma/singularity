#### 2.1 A basic outline of machine taxonomy (with examples)
![tom](../../../../attachments/taxonomy_of_machines.svg) 


#### 2.2 The closest definition of a machine in this context then, is something like an origami sculpture - _a structure "folded" into function(s)_.

2.2.1 Just as complex creations arise out of a small number of folding techniques in the Japanese art form, complex machines arise out of combinations, permutations, and repetitions of simpler ones.

2.2.2 What is structured is the folding function, what is functional is the folded structure.

2.2.2.1 The folding is a function of the structure, the function is a base upon which, or into which structure is operated upon.

2.2.2.2 Structure is pronounced as states and announced into connections upon each discrete fold producing in each iteration connected and connectionless states, and stateful and stateless connections. 

2.2.3 What is folded and folded into are not just protiens, dimensions, and uncertainties, but even epistemic modes are arranged as an assortment of primitive bends and creases.

2.2.4 Transcendence the structureless fold, or foldless structure as a primitive fold occurs without any and all structure, the rest operate within the folds of cognition.

2.2.4.1 Qualia and its praxis are both antinomically rooted in relations oblique to the real, imaginary, and symbolic. 

2.2.4.1.1 Epistemological modes are vernaculars of function whose input and output is substance. 

2.2.4.3 The source of epistemic integration is the fold itself, the modes mere creases apparent with an infinitesimal frequency. 

2.2.4.3 Transcendence is modality of episteme apriori, an integration of the sum and knowledge the differentiation by original function.


#### 2.3 All machines are state machines reductively and asymptotically, knowledge for and of machines is always already knowledge of their states.

2.3.1 For example, matter is a finite state machine with four common (and four uncommon) states.

2.3.2 By contrast, substance or extension is an infinite state machine that includes states of qualia and transcendence.

2.3.3 Knowledge of states is knowledge of a "translation", both in mathematical and linguistic sense.

2.3.3.1 In an n-dimensional universe, a single state can be represented by a n-1 lexical system or a base n-1 numeral system. A two-dimensional planet will have one pole, a three dimensional two.

2.3.3.2 This loss in translation is always the loss of original state, this loss represents the primordial fold, the genesis of transcendence.

2.3.4 All states are states of the transcendence _translated_ - mechanically, biophysically, or transcendentally (as in deus ex machina).

2.3.5 States are broadcasts via mediums known variously as connections, relationships, channels etc. 

2.3.5.1 A flower blooms, its fragrance announces the change, attracting pollinating agents perpetuating the transition.


#### 2.4 A functional quanta of a state machine is a configuration _of_ the state machine

2.4.1 Configuration may appear as a fold in associated structure, such as a bend in a pipe or as a constellation, or as a fold in pure function as in sexual or magnetic polarity.

2.4.2 Configuration is a state space quantized by chains of extant structural-functional bindings, colour is structural binding, culture a functional configuration - "race" a combined state space.

2.4.3 Bindings are narratives of states emergent in _association_ with and _assignation_ of other machines. A nation state is a binding, as is a book.   

2.4.3.1 Different configurations arise as a consequence of these associations and assignations. 

2.4.3.1.1 The porosity of a towel is a configuration of the yarn arising as a consequence of its assignation by the loom.

2.4.3.1.2 The colour of the towel is an assignating binding of the dye.

2.4.3.1.3 Both color and porosity are thus configurations of the towel, however its wetness and dryness are states arising out of association with water.

2.4.3.1.4 A towel faded in color after years of use has changed in configuration, one that has been torn has leaped over states of structural integrity.


#### 2.5 Feedback is a feature of extension, the biopolitical and desiring consumption of states (and configurations).

2.5.1 Feedback is to singleton state or configuration what deus ex machina is to machina or machine.

2.5.2 In so far as a state is representative of configuration extant, feedback is representative of discipline active.

2.5.3 All states originate and terminate in feedback, which originates and terminates in original state.

2.5.4 Unlike states, the knowledge of feedback is not a translation, for there is no space to decenter extension, nor can there be a language of languages that simultaneously expresses atomic facts in all dialects.
