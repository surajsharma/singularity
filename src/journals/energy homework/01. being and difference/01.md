# being and difference 

1. 


- From womb to tomb, time has no gaps. Through waking life as well as through states of apperception like dreams, coma or altered perception like meditative, sleep, under the influence of chemicals benign or otherwise such as anesthesia etc. the virtual fabric of time knows no physical holes - neither on the number line, nor in provenance of memory.


- Even death is not untouched by the continuation of time in narratives of reincarnation, astral travel, karma and the like - which the spiritual literature of the world regurgitates frequently and fondly.


- In this seemingly homogeneous unity, difference is introduced - usually in and as a habitus - as a chain of repetition dividing firstly time and the cognition thereof, and secondly, the perception of this difference with itself pervasively, infinitely, and recursively, creating a feedback loop that ushers tomorrow into today.


- What introduces this difference is not time itself, neither anything "perceived", not only because perception assumes time apriori but also because time, in as much as it appears to be "caused" to the being, always appears as something external to perception, and therefore is always outside its control. It is as if, slipstreaming in through a blind spot in cognition, time injects itself into extension creating substance. 


- The bastardized motionless stillness of extension without father time is a singular blind spot which cannot be confirmed by determination synthetic or rigor analytic. 
  
  
- The narrative of the "big bang" assumes a solitary accident describing the incidence of time, as if the observable universe is a single boat set adrift on memory bliss of a single observer who just happens to be a monothiest solipsist. It may shock the followers of abrahamic religions but it is possible to have more than one biological father. The scientific term for this anomaly is "heteropaternal superfecundation". Although the rare exception bears likeness to the anomaly John Donne called a "child with a mandrake root". 


- The practicality of unary numeral systems belongs to academic excursions alone, the holes on Spongebob's body cannot be counted with a single numeral for 1 is already the second number. All pluralities are already constituted by systems of other pluralities, necessitating the abstractions of higher dimensions in mathematics. 


- The embodied experience of being allows for little discernment of time as a single dimensional vector. Whatever occurs _is_ a slice of whatever _could be_, not whatever _is_, for whatever _is_, has already occurred and what has already occured apriori is _difference_. 


- What causes time in the being is the difference that is mind, or the time-sharing "society of mind" which is a multivariate difference in itself. Mind, which is reconstituted by and for the being from its own splinters strewn across time. Mind is a dialectical composition of memory decomposing inside the being.  
  
  
- From within the embodied being one likes to call self, time appears linear and not at all in a superposition as claims to quantum gravity seem to suggest. The linear limitation is entirely biological, for the cessation of time in a dead body is nothing if not the cessation of memory. Memory as the biological consequence of time is indeed being's only road to unraveling this mystery. Memory is the political economy of time, the fetishization of time as a commodity. 


- The cessation of memory is not the same as apperception or altered perception, in that, as far as the being is concerned, there is a finality  without duplication or further propagation.


- In death, difference lives with as much violence as in its introduction - leaving behind only memory of someone's memories. In memory dwell differences, but difference itself is a function of a static, stationary, undifferentiated and infinitely liminal production known as pure difference.  
  
  
- Difference is difference, but the _difference of difference_ is "pure" not in the sense of being a "meta" state, making it nearly impossible to ever achieve a total metaphysics because all meta states conclude logically in a _reductio ad infinitum_. 


- Nor is the difference of difference a "post" difference for to imply a causation to difference is akin to saying the difference between one and two is not absolute in itself, but one occasionally becomes two and thus achieving a "post" oneness. "Pre" and "post" are already conditions of active difference, which is always an image of before and after framed together.


- "Pure" difference is Moses as a market-maker, creating two oceans from one, at least for those who still believe in old myths, if not thermodynamics. The reason its called "pure" is perhaps to signify its incorruptibility, there is nothing "pure" outside pure difference. More precisely, it is Shiva's third eye, the mother of chaos.

 
- Exhaustively, pure difference is not Sissyphus but Maxwell's demon, Eris not Kali, an earthquake-on-demand not a sought-after deluge. It is a feedback that creates a lateral difference in both amplitude and frequency instead of simply an amplification or deamplification in the monotonous similarity of the daily drudge of signal. Not a "flat circle" but a Möbius strip. Pure difference is the duality of difference and every duality casts an inseparable shadow through the realms of being.


- Pure difference is why no two differences are alike and for the being braided between the fundamental differences of birth and death, the bookends speak volumes about the library. The singularity out of which duality is emergent, this splitting of the sum that is the whole, this shattering of the fragile innocence of the absolute, this is death of pure difference is a decay of two phases (φ/ϕ) of difference - into L-systems traversed by time and its entourage, memory, where both φ and ϕ are self-contained systems of differences eternal.


- This "lub" and "dub" heard in each heartbeat as the twilight nears, is an _attribution_ of not one duality but two; attesting that for being, the dualism of birth and death mirrorred in the very adjacent dualism of mind and body, creates a meeting or relationship, which leads to creation of other dualisms (or relationships, or meetings) inside continuous chains of reaction such as health and illness, small and big, rich and poor, master and slave etc. 


- Descartes' big project was to understand this dualistic system reductively through doubt, but the immediacy of memory, and the continuity of perception create a dense soup leaving little wiggle room for doubt. Doubt dissolves quickly in excruciating pain or euphoric highs leaving being in fear. Descartes' hyperbolic doubt (and its shadow, hyperbolic fear) are both faces of zero on the number line. Both integers and whole numbers exist as shadow of zero, and zero exists as the counterpart of infinity. In such a squaring off of numbers, asking _why_ there is something rather than nothing is the lesser question. Pure difference is difference _incognito_.
  
  
- The answer to all _why_ questions is the image of the one asking. Even Descartes in the end could not separate the cogito from its reflection, the sum. For the cognition asking _why_ determined to go beyond the _why not_, the answer is simple and expressible in a word or two - to the cogito determined by violence, the "why"/"why not" is a violent dualism, to that which is motivated by perfection, it is revealed as a perfection. Why pure difference is a mirror _is itself_ a pure difference that _is_ the mirror, _cognosco, ergo sum_. 
  
  
- Succinctly, Anselm's argument is correct in that being itself is the freedom of the recall of being, and the being that cannot recall itself is not perfect, but the scale of this freedom, and the degree of this perfection is difficult to fathom, which makes the lay person find succor in the bounds of the lowest common denomination of critical thinking, in the comfort zone of borrowed questions such as why. Had little red riding hood discovered her granny in the bed instead of the wolf, the _why_ questions would not have ensued. More often than not, the being that asks the faithless _why_ is being that cannot reconcile with what they see in the mirror. Those that can drop the baggage of accumulated "knowledge", rise above petty inquiries and swim onwards and upwards into what comes after it. 


- The twice-ejected being is rather first "geworfen" into the plot as a tragedy, then thrown out of it with impunity and indifference of a hypocritical farce. In between is a tweening of past, present, and future - modalities of memory screening through time as if models on a Kantian runway. Generative antinomies - for they imply, however anorexically, a self-referential, self-causal loop. Nevertheless, feedback cannot be self-caused, the signal exists _causa sui_ and recognizes itself _suo motu_. Why the bride must be unveiled or carried across the threshold is the reason for marriage and vice versa. It is not the sunrise that powers faith but faith that attests to the sunrise, just as death attests whether a life was well-lived or not.


- One can see that the signal that is the being's life is a a pair of two movements upon a network of statis drawn between two cul-de-sacs that at once terminate into and extend out of each other, thus actually being is stretched on a crossroads. The negative roll in the projector moves only vertically, but the image on the screen has both vertical and horizontal movement. Digital memory is one-dimensional but Mario can jump both up and down.


- Each movement is the representative of this interstitiality of memory. Motion itself is an additive synthesis of memory, producing not only the real image that is _geist_, spirit or bone, but also unreal images like motion pictures and animated films. Indeed more generally all storytelling within memory, including the storytelling with mediums such as music is a clever use of motion, the pacing of memory.


- The singular cause of all duality invites attempts at elucidations varied and contested throughout history, the truth is as simple as a crucifix, a four-way system of two distinct dualities. A "two-sided" L-system upon which being is composing and decomposing. Not the unuttered duality of ੴ  (which is itself a doubling of the singularity that is ॐ), but its doubling in each utterance creating a tetragrammaton connecting back to YHWH until the question which is begged is not an inquisition of something but a tort of negligence of nothing.


- Memory is the melancholy of nothing neglected so in a total recall, everything is recollected. Something is the recall of nothing remembering how much of nothing it is. It takes a lot of nothing recalled to create the something which is recall itself. This recall casts a shadow that appears to being as past, present, and future. 



- This then is the primary duality, a nothing and its recall, the original magician and his original apprentice, the organ-grinder and the monkey, incorrigible narcissus and his infinite reflection, the ego and its "I". One possible ontology of time as the prime mover, the one that is zero and the one that is 1 repeated as its own addition into infinity.


- The shadow of this primary duality, is a secondary couple - a trinity and a quarternity completing one fourfold revolution of dasein in time. Considering the purity of nothing, and its senile (thus impure) recall that is something, we can establish a similar lateral parallel which connects the trinity to the singularity and the quarternity to the duality.


- Trinities abound but mentions of quarternities are encountered less frequently and talked about even rarely. The binary that is the original duality, and the binary that is its counterpose are arranged in a "quad" where grows a perennial tree of pure difference. Just as zero explodes into one, all singularities, dualities, and trinities light their own pyre in their own corresponding sums.


- It takes millions of triangles to create a 3D scene, each of which hides not only itself but the infrastructure that is the mesh forming the characters and the landscape. The abject neglect of each triangle, its repression and submission into the mesh leads to the return of the scene out of memory - consumed and once again forgotten in the production of productions. Genome hides in sequences of four letters and computer memory in multiples of four for the same reasons as revolutions of the earth hide inside one day of each leap year. To arrive at four from one, or three from zero then, is no ordinary leap, but a total revolution of difference.


- Like all leaps, the certitude of faith powers the fourfold movement of memory in memory, and the Abraham and Issac that return from Moriah are not the Abraham and Issac that started the ascent.


- Memory as eternal return appears thus to be a symphony with four distinct and unique movements, each with undeniably different style. Movement to and from history and the movement to and from future in a dialectically emergence that is present. This of course repeats eternally because both past and fututre are cul-de-sacs.


- The holy grail of cognition as a subject, the essence of eternal return, and the end of all existential ennui is a production of memory as a unitary image - the entelechy of time in dasein, memory immortalised as a transcendent machine or _transcendental memory_.


- Memory sprouts in the harvest of difference from pure difference, eternally until the next crop - for in pure difference "_boredom is the root of all evil_", as Kierkegaard puts it. With each successive birth, the crop of memory rotates somewhat until an exhausted memory reaches a fallow period. Whereupon a new season of fertility begins.
