- As the first relation between difference and pure differance, transcendental 5memory isn't some jewel in the heart of atlantis, but the very bridge between the principal I-Thou, which is a less tentative polarity its more material, shallower cousin "master/slave". The reason I-Thou is preferable is a kind of Hanlon's Razor, whereas marxist dialectical implies the causal consequences only on relationships of materiality, Buber goes further and shaves off the very moral fiber of relationship itself. Dasein's relationships constitute most of its life, but the objective of all relationships (including those circumscribed by scientific materialism) is to reach the self.


- Dasein as self is a relation that is a product of difference that differentiates, divides perception into innumerable categories and discerns among them inside the absolute pluripotentiality of pure difference - one of whose image is transcendental memory.  


- It is not an injunction of its environment making being appropriate its time as divided into diurnal, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles - or for that matter into childhood, teenage, adulthood, and old age, rather it is its very constitution down to the nth fraction of a second - this constitution, a slice of the whole of memory, is but an image abstracted towards the generality of dasein.


- The reason perception, memory, and time are rent asunder in images because being itself is an expression of difference. In a few billion years, even the sun will have been, leaving behind a few photographs of the glory that was day except it will be difficult to procure enough light to make said image visible, and if one did purchase some old battery to see the extinguished ball, immediate tragedy shall ensue eliminating the remaining population. For the same reason, raiding tombs of cursed mummies is a risky adventure.


- Dasein as an image is a featureless plateau colored only incidentally by the parallax of its relationships, the very basis of which is its relationship with itself as particular. The only crests and troughs on this plateau are movements in memory - remembering and forgetting - more generally image is a field in a flux of potential and actual rememberances.


- Forgetting then, is not a failure of memory but a sight catalysed or conditioned oversight. There are no lapses in memory, there is either the remembering of something else, or a sliding into fantasy or past. One may recall with great discernment and in great detail even mundane details from one's history with the same precision with which one can predict one's location at a date some time in the future, but both predictions and recalls require the fuel of determination in the present.
  
  
- What is "forgotten" is never lost for forgetting is paradox, the anguish of being is such that had it the power to forget, it would use it to forget everything and anything, but like the fabled pink elephant, the repressed returns with renewed vigor. Schr√∂dinger's cat is like the keychain you misplaced last time until you found it, between the time you lost and found it, it was an artifact in transcendental memory - regardless of how many people saw it lying on the mantle, it was not there until you recalled its coordinates or somehow otherwise chanced upon it - including having someone else find it for you.


- Difference emergent from a self-alienated pure difference becomes a stable, self-sufficient configuration of negation.


- This configuration is completely virtual and hyperreal in the sense that what was real in pure difference is now extended and continues from it - a disembodied narcissus is born and gazes back from the reflection that defines it and into the entity that is reflected, all cognition is a reminiscence of this original gaze.


- The dense indeterminate singular subject optatively brings forth a sparse object, a shallow and determinate mutation thus creating a bi-directional system of causal inference in what is now a potent gradient of information.


- Since there is nothing perceivable or perceptive about this system yet, any descriptive analysis of subject-object juxtaposition can only be binary-linguistic.


- Although the system is primarily dual, difference between the two necessitates a boundary or border, or in terms of deconstruction, a "frame".


-  A near-symbolic object and a near-imaginary subject cannot transact (virtually or othwerwise) without the presence of a mediator of some sort, they are entities as disparate as a signal broadcasted for radio and a switched off receiver. 


-  A kind of lemmata thus is apparent, whether seen as Derrida's complicated notion of frame, or more simply, any one of the members of Buber's trinity of I-It-Thou. An agency at the border that turns on the radio and tunes it into a frequency.


-  In the time it has taken for the simple duality to fract-ure into a trinity all of time has come to pass.  


-  This mediating agency is the positive synthesis between two systemic negations, an interface shared over two parts of a single duality, similar to a day between two nights or an afternoon between two twilights.


- It is a plane of similarity existence stretching across two faces of difference, allowing one to be interpreted as a recall of the other - linguistically the connecting thread between signifier and signified. More concretely, image itself.


- In everyday life, we see the interface at work when we recognize a spelling mistake or identify the original brand from a cheap knock-off. Even more obviously, when we identify heads from tails on a coin or differentiate between the obverse and reverse sides of a physical photograph. To be even more incredulous, image is what allows difference to be recognized. Without image no systems of difference may be related, no network of meaning may emerge, no gaze may be formed.


- Certainly, image here does not refer to the phenomenology of vision alone 'image' is just an apt signifier for the interface because vision is common and easier to understand than other sense data. Indeed, for a sentience that did not have eyesight but only aural senses, a bone would be a sound alone and for two-dimensional 'flatlanders', the image would be a two-dimensional record. Like echolocation in bats.


- Thus, facilitating the relationship between narcissus and his reflection is the surface of the water that affords an infinite recall. 


- An interface is a potential image, whereas an image is the representation of actuated potential. Without narcissus' reflection, the surface of water is a negation not too dissimilar from the negative used in photographic film. Similarly, narcissus' face is a negation without recall of its features and the recall itself, the impression or memory of the reflection - is also a negation until the water surface activates it. Through the mediation of the interface the dialectical completes its work in image formation. The featureless platueau of self is exactly such a potential image, the tabula rasa inscribed on the underside.


- Being imagines itself a fire extinguisher waiting for an entity to break glass and put out the memories burning as if without - but the way out of difference and into pure difference is a recall of something so dutifully ignored it seems to be long forgetten, except the thing forgotten is forgetfulness itself.


- In birth the mother that is body divides and in death consciousness is factored out of the biological isness or reification of the body that is mother. What is sought in each case is an emancipatory movement "outward", away from the chaos of dense difference and into the balmier shores of memory where difference is sparse.


- The engine of this movement, or in fruedian terms, this "death drive" of the being is in itself a simulation of the first relationship - that of pure difference with difference - and is thus an expression of the relationship of dasein with itself. 


- For how does one come to create the "self" one is all too familiar with when one looks in the morning mirror except through a system of differences - an infintely complex scaffolding of masks borrowed first from "das man" and then made malleable, refactored until they resonate with memory.


- The engine of the "death drive" is the same ancient I-Thou relationship difference has with pure difference.


- The being thus is its own master and its own slave, and it is not the case that being sometimes dons a mask of its own master and sometimes that of its own slave but every mask it puts on is permeated with this duality. For example smoking, outwardly an act of masterly definace and rebellion, inwardly a slavish addiction to nicotine. 


- The duality of the mask and the duality contained in the "death drive" are actually identical. Following our well-established logic of the recursively constituted absolute, it is safe to conclude that death is also a mask of difference.


- The universality of the I-Thou relationship stems from the very basic fact of the first separation of pure difference and difference. In this childless divorce, the completely exhausted pure differnce birthed its only offspring and tasked it to divide further.


- "_Go forth and divide_" seems an oddly satanic instruction to give but we must remember that pure difference is the essence of negation. The locus of our discussion being the flow of power, or authority from the higher to the lower thus creating the first hierarchy.  


- From there onwards, all relationships come to categorize a self-contained hierarchy and every duality came retrofitted with a gradient across which power can flow.
 

- Consider the double tragedy of poor difference, ejected from the kingdom of its father who died during the very act of banishing its only child. Now consider that we are still living through it.


- Thus is the twice-excommunicated, thrice-dead dasein "geworfen", first into the difference of reality and then into the difference of irreality. First divided out of the imaginary, then divided out of the symbolic and the real. 


- But not only in birth and death, the being follows this pattern of division through each moment, ceaselessly exhaling and inhaling difference, swallowing and excreting entropy - which is a measure of distance from the original event.


- It would be illogical to assume that first fracturing  and the eventual mitosis of pure difference occured without a mediating agency. For without agency, even a purely chaotic, negatively constitued whole neither could nor would have self-destructed so flamboyantly. That agency is memory - in rememberance is God animated and dasein reanimated.
