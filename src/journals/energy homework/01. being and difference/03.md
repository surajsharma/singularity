- As the first relation between difference and pure differance, transcendental memory isn't some jewel in the heart of atlantis, but the very bridge between the principal I-Thou, which is one hop, skip, and jump away from its marxist cousin "master/slave". The reason I-Thou is preferable is a kind of Hanlon's Razor, whereas marxist interpretation implies the causal consequences only on relationships of materiality, Buber goes further and shaves off the very moral fiber of relationship itself. Dasein's relationships constitute most of its life, but the objective of all relationships (including those circumscribed by scientific materialism) is to reach the self.


- Dasein as self is a relation that is a product of difference that differentiates, divides perception into innumerable categories and discerns among them inside the absolute pluripotentiality of pure difference - one of whose image is transcendental memory.  


- It is not an injunction of its environment making being appropriate its time as divided into diurnal, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles - or for that matter into childhood, teenage, adulthood, and old age, rather it is its very constitution down to the nth fraction of a second - this constitution, a slice of the whole of memory, is but an image abstracted towards the generality of dasein.


- The reason perception, memory, and time are rent asunder in images because being itself is an expression of difference. In a few billion years, even the sun will have been, leaving behind a few photographs of the glory that was day except it will be difficult to procure enough light to make said image visible, and if one did purchase some old battery to see the extinguished ball, immediate tragedy shall ensue eliminating the remaining population. For the same reason, raiding tombs of cursed mummies is a risky adventure.


- Dasein as an image is a featureless plateau colored only incidentally by the parallax of its relationships, the very basis of which is its relationship with itself as particular. The only crests and troughs on this plateau are movements in memory - remembering and forgetting - more generally a field in a flux of rememberances.


- Forgetting is not a failure of memory but a conditioned oversight, there are no lapses in memory, there is either the remembering of something else, or a sliding into fantasy or past.
  
  
- Schr√∂dinger's cat is like the keychain you misplaced last time until you found it, between the time you lost and found it, it was an artifact in transcendental memory - regardless of how many people saw it lying on the mantle, it was not there until you recalled its coordinates or somehow otherwise chanced upon it - including having someone else find it for you.


- Difference emergent from a self-alienated pure difference becomes a stable, self-sufficient configuration of negation.


- This configuration is completely virtual and hyperreal in the sense that what was real in pure difference is now extended and continues from it - a disembodied narcissus is born and gazes back from the reflection that defines it and into the entity that is reflected, all cognition is a reminiscence of this original gaze.


- The dense indeterminate singular subject optatively brings forth a sparse object, a shallow and determinate mutation thus creating a bi-directional system of causal inference in what is now a potent gradient of information.


- Since there is nothing perceivable or perceptive about this system yet, any descriptive analysis of subject-object juxtaposition can only be binary-linguistic.


- Although the system is primarily dual, difference between the two necessitates a boundary or border, or in terms of deconstruction, a "frame".


-  A near-symbolic object and a near-imaginary subject cannot transact (virtually or othwerwise) without the presence of a mediator of some sort, they are entities as disparate as a signal broadcasted for radio and a switched off receiver. 


-  A kind of lemmata thus is apparent, whether seen as Derrida's complicated notion of frame, or more simply, any one of the members of Buber's trinity of I-It-Thou. An agency at the border that turns on the radio and tunes it into a frequency.


-  In the time it has taken for the simple duality to fract-ure into a trinity all of time has come to pass.  


-  This mediating agency is the positive synthesis between two systemic negations, an interface shared over two parts of a single duality, similar to a day between two nights or an afternoon between two twilights.


- It is a plane of similarity existence stretching across two faces of difference, allowing one to be interpreted as a recall of the other - linguistically the connecting thread between signifier and signified. More concretely, image itself.


- In everyday life, we see the interface at work when we recognize a spelling mistake or identify the original brand from a cheap knock-off. Even more obviously, when we identify heads from tails on a coin or differentiate between the obverse and reverse sides of a physical photograph. To be even more incredulous, image is what allows difference to be recognized. Without image no systems of difference may be related, no network of meaning may emerge, no gaze may be formed.


- Certainly, image here does not refer to the phenomenology of vision alone 'image' is just an apt signifier for the interface because vision is common and easier to understand than other sense data. Indeed, for a sentience that did not have eyesight but only aural senses, a bone would be a sound alone and for two-dimensional 'flatlanders', the image would be a two-dimensional record. Like echolocation in bats.


- Thus, facilitating the relationship between narcissus and his reflection is the surface of the water that affords an infinite recall. 


- An interface is a potential image, whereas an image is the representation of actuated potential. Without narcissus' reflection, the surface of water is a negation not too dissimilar from the negative used in photographic film. Similarly, narcissus' face is a negation without recall of its features and the recall itself, the impression or memory of the reflection - is also a negation until the water surface activates it. Through the mediation of the interface the dialectical completes its work in image formation. The featureless platueau of self is exactly such a potential image, the tabula rasa inscribed on the underside.


- Two things of relative importance arise from this understanding - one, the formal difference between potential and active memory and two the dialectical structure of difference itself which is seemingly a difference ensnaring a duality from both constituent sides, without which, one is dealing exclusively in scalar differences.
