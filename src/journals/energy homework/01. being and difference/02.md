2.


- Nothing alienates like responsibility, this was Kierkegaard's pain, because if one accepts responsibility, one has to maintain it all the way to causal principles, this isn't a moral injunction but a determined preference, the zeroth either/or, but it is a choiceless choice for being is determinism exemplified. Hegel was less hesitant, if after all, the absolute sublates or condenses into dewdrops in the morning, the synthesis is an analytical fact, but the debate rages on whether the skepticism of the confounded ego should be considered a mask of fear and trembling.


- Whether or not dasein is determined to derive responsibility from the finitude of corporeal difference, an existential continuity decorates decay in patterns fashioned out of history. A face of historical resemblances continues to command and dictate the fracturing of pure and original difference - sometimes with care and precision, sometimes in seemingly stochastic and improvised loops.


- The oft-repeated refrain in either channel of lived experience is the dread and horror of absolute difference, the terror of absolute freedom from the "what if"s and from the fear of missing out on the thing happening elsewhere - the devouring of difference by difference is much more palatable than difference dividing itself into the dead eye of nought. In this dark and stormy night filled with thunderous rancour, resounding condescension, and retributive reproach of the gods is causality born. 


- For dasein, causality is not the popular belief in the succession of time through events, but the appearance of pure difference inside of time, the double abduction of before and after in the shambolic now. Causality is Munch's _Der Schrei der Natur_, an infinity resonating through discrete moments giving the appearance of pure difference peeking into each isolated sunset. To the dasein that is afraid, everything becomes constituted by fear, just ask a hypochondriac. But the being initially determined by fearlessness can see the wonder that is behind this screaming mask. 


- What Munch percevied as his muse is infact what the Hindus optatively refer to as ‡•ê, and while it could be asserted that in his lack of enlightenment he interpreted as an eternal cosmic horror, but this is not the case. Like an average westerner, he had no ontology to grasp the import of his existential referendum both biophysically and in terms of his own desires. It wasn't the case that Munch was retarded or lacked sophistication but it was simply a matter of epistemic tooling. If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. The horror of the scream on the obverse side becomes Monalisa's enigmatic smile and perhaps this is the reason there is not a trace of paranoia and horror nearly equivalent in the entirety of Indian art. 
 

- This is not to assert the counterfactual case that had Munch been an Indian or Chinese he would have interpreted it differently, rather that he was determined all the way to witness the hollow void of his historical existence realised as an inversion of cadence he understood as the truth. But its not just Munch, the quinian indeterminacy of translation often leaves an already traumatised being in a metaphysical lurch which is more dangerous than simple ennui. In a metaphysical lurch one is liable to act irresponsibly. When the symbolism of language breaks down, and economic harnesses appear to have failed, and when all one has seen is wars and crusades piled upon each other, nature's paranoia gets weaponized in such landscapes of decay and one's determination to see evil in the neutrality of space and time is reified.


- Such catachresis of desire in a more social setting makes for unsettling and even cautionary tales of the psyche getting lost in the lightlessness of dasein. Ontologies are born in such nights of the "soul", but without knowledge of soul, the nights get darker, more often than not ending in therapy if not suicide, riots, revolutions, or the original exorcism - war. This ontological relativity between psyches is determined cosmologically as the  microwave background - where stripped of its ancient overlays, radiation flows ceaselessly all the way back to and from the event tribally christened "big bang". The reason Munch's work got famous is the mimetic transmission of desire and its justifications - a literal parallel of how hysteria spreads from individual to society at large - the painting is a parable of the original negation.


- Causality is the nativity of time, recorded on the _unterschied_ of difference. Through causality, time becomes a common resource to all other differences and their expression, a thread of _similarity_ or self-similarity that runs through everything. To chance upon this similarity, this difference of difference, as a surprise is to witness the "scream" that permeates the mood in moments of acute paranoia, disorder, and anxiety. 


- Any dissection of causality leads to a deterministic triple play of cause - _embutements_ - effect. The ball let go from one's hand does not land on floor immediately, but the fall is punctuated by a series of determined moments during which the ball is mid-air. This relative integration of absolutely determined states comes to define dasein between the liminality of terminating events known as birth and death.


- Similarity is the product of original negation by itself in that pure difference could but differ from itself, or two negative numbers multipied yeild a positive one. In the production of difference, history could but differ from both past and future. It is the barrel even Diogenes could not help but live inside - continuity is the difference that is Spinoza's failing eyesight whereas causality is the familiar falling of the dust from the lenses being ground. However, _post hoc ergo propter hoc_ so mere units of difference and pure difference cannot render the whole frame. The final piece of the puzzle is the _deterministic relativity_ that interweaves interweaving pure and 'impure' difference, hitherto visible to the scientific eye as strong and weak nuclear forces.


- The determinism comes from the sheer purity of pure difference - it is the forcefulness of the lion's roar understood by all - the relativity however, is a delicate canary in the coalmine chirping away twice in a single breath - it is heard by few who take heed and understood by fewer for like all dualities it is dissonant as a mercurial ocean breaking upon itself inside the context-free grammar of a Lindenmayer system which is its square basin. This is literally the flatness of time bending to accomodate space as general relativity has shown. This relativity is also deterministic for time could but cause space to arrive, just as on a Proustian trigger of the senses, dasein cannot help a flooding of memory incoming.


- Summarily, the eternal torture that is the being of pure difference cried out to the tune called time which imagined its own medium as a space to contain itself and the rest is history. Pure difference itself was born in the memory of being upturned, that is the being different in a way that there remained nothing selective about its memory - being with transcendental memory - or 'om'niscient being, the being common-in-difference of all other beings. No wonder then that the entirely virtual image on the retina is an upturned or inverted one.


- Zooming into causality we find more differential determinations, but zooming out we find the differential smoothens out into a curvature. The event known as the "big bang" is thus an inverted, smoothened image of pure difference that belies its true form and consequence. 


- The analytical circularity of truth is thus an illusory by-product to the being determined to inquire into it. To the being determined to go beyond appearances, truth is angular like cuts on a diamond or freshly mined coal. This angularity and curvature is once again a deterministically lowered interstitiality - chemical compounds are represented as straight lines and polygons, however upon zooming in we find the curved representations of atomic particles which in turn are built upwards from the geometrical one-pointedness of subatomic particles. 


- Conversely, being's position in the hierarchy of its evolution is another immediate cause for this dichotomy - insect vision is much less "anti-aliased", computers have to work hard to achieve it, and human stands on the verge of losing it to gain the next straightening of the mind's eye.


- In so far as raw pressed sugarcane can be identified from the bagasse and rolled up cuffs of can identify the shirt, curvature of things leads to a better understanding - but in the purity of the absolute truth is as straight as lines on one's forehead - a knowledge which is infinitely symmetrical, certain, direct, and immediate without much beating around the bush. As Hegel correctly said, "spirit is a bone", and its curvature the cage.


- The most important point isn't the straightness or curvature of reality, but the interstitiality of the two - here is where the credits roll and one can leave the theater. Between the well-rounded figure of zero and the angular determination of One is an exit into pure difference. This is the essence of Buddha's "middle path" and looking far enough into the workings of quantum gravity, the cause of the geodesic shape of the earth.


- Pure difference folded upon itself as layers of difference which themselves are woven in interlocking patterns of mutually relative binary systems present a reality that appears as space perforated with bits of matter and time punctuated not only with moments of timelessness such as sleep but also self-similar constituencies of time such as orgasmic or meditative states, switched-off or redundant states, coma, or alcohol and drug-induced states.


- Time is the perforation that marks the borders between one dimension and another, across the transverse of which extends difference as planes of angularly folded faces of a singular, n-polytope in a hilbert space (or Sobolev space). Our observable universe is one such face.


- The blind spot of the "big bang", or a singular entry point of time into substance is therefore a myth perpetuated by parochial and limited scientific foresight, there isn't a single original fold but as many as there are dimensions available for observation, which surely as mathematics confirms, are more than three (or four if one considers time as a dimension).


-  The perforations themselves form a duality consisting of succession of stiches and gaps between them. Yhe stitch being an instance of difference and the cause of memory (difference welded to successive difference) whereas the gap is a stretch of pure difference and the field of transcendental memory (difference separated from itself).


- A lot could go differently between the disloging of the apple from the tree and it's impact with Newton's head, or between the time a bullet leaves the muzzle to meet its target, causal studies of time conclude into multiverses here. Our argument isn't that causality branches out at each integral step of the way and we only experience but one of the multitudes, but rather that being is reminded of a singularity as opposed to recalling every permutation extant (which would be dissociatively irrational state of cognitive chaos). 


- It is therefore pertinent to discern between causality and continuation - what binds the diurnal nature of being's experience of time isn't a predetermined chain of cause-and-effect, but a determined political economy of continuity that intends to tell a singular story instead of a cacophony of bewildering qualia.


- Continuity is linear time, while causality is quadratic hence can have more than a single solution or outcome of any possible eventuality. Continuity unfolds at the intersecting differentials of time and memory whereas causality is phenomenon witnessed by the integrity of memory. Indeed, there are mental afflictions that corrupt this integrity and result in a loss of faculties to establish causality but only death is the end of continuation.


- Clocks are to time what mirrors are to space, if the face of being is visible on a mirror, surely one should be able to see the face of time on a clock. Analog watches need at least two needles to tell current time - every minute on which is the state of the L-system that is space over which time is broken infinitely. Every degree of the shadow triangle on the face of a sundial is a similar representation.


- Cognitively speaking, the bend, crease, and fold dialectic is directly mapped to cognition, object, and subject. Alternatively, it can be stated as the dialectic of the observation, observer, and the observed subject.


- If time was matter, causality would be its density whereas continuity would be its volume. They are two sides of the same coin where causality is the repetition or purity of time, continuity is causality recalled or the differential in each repetition. As Constantine Constantius says, "repetition and recollection are the same movement, just in opposite directions".


- We now begin to see how observed time cannot be a finite expression of the infinite, just as any solid, liquid, or gas filling a container cannot express more than the contours of the container will allow it to. In other words, just as all possibilities and probabilities of the life of a rotting wound are already contained within the cauterization, time is the sum of all memories, the sum of all differences in itself.


- Exactly which of these probabilities is alotted to observation is a dependent chain of differences leading all the way to the first one. this is the essence of the buddhist doctrine of __pratityasamutpada__.


- This apparent chain of causality is dense locally but at levels of abstraction greater than sensory data allows, the chain grows sparse until both cause and effect cease to exist. 


- This density of time, this inescapable labyrinth of events that dictates our everyday life is a deconstriction decoupled from the actual state of affairs to the point that it appears to ensnare us with it's magnified, exaggerated version the real until we are enslaved to follow it like a perforated page being torn from a diary.


- However, a page being torn from a diary need not necessarily follow the perforation. Occasionally, albeit rarely, and of late increasingly rarely, by acts of omission or commission, by dint of will or chance, a peek is affored into the obverse of time.


- A being a determined thus, can break the loop of eternal return to arrive at transcendental memory, which is memory in superposition, a door which opens into pure difference itself. Though this journey is so fraught with existential, mythical, and symbolic dangers and fears that few attempt and fewer still arrive at the destination.


- Transcendental memory is a disembodied phenomenon. It isn't a recall of all time in the mind but a recall of all time outside of any and all minds - in terms of its interface with pure difference, it is the rememberance of all forgetting - the realm of all things lost, the kingdom of the imaginary. It is a leak in memory however imperceptible, minute, or seconded from mainstream of time - a phenomenon strong and unnatural enough to be equated with stepping out, for the first time, of Plato's cave.


- Though the superhighway of time be marked into lanes and exits, there is a difference between the mere existence of an exit on the difference superhighway and the act of taking said exit. Just as there is a difference between witnessing a different lane and switching in or out of it. Usual time does not allow even the observation of the existence of such an exit from time as we rush past it preoccupied with the baggage of all moments preceding. Thus buried in every moment is its negative, and openly hidden within time - like Poe's purloined letter - is a timelessness.


- On the rare occassion such an exit is witnessed it gets ignored, or bypassed as a two-bit deviance from the norm - the symptoms of which may include anything between seasonal affective disorder to full blown schitzophrenic attacks. Rarer still is the occassion, whereupon one either takes said exit willingly, or is left with no other route - herein not only the destination changes, but the point of original departure changes as well. __Pratityasamutpada__ can be raised to the nth degree, dependent origination in a quantum flux is the sanctum sanctorum of pure difference.


-  Arriving at the sanctum sanctorum of difference is not just emancipatory, but emancipatory to the nth degree. However, the elucidation of such a frozen artifact of timlessness and memorylessness is not a function of language, for language is a phenomenon occuring in time - thus it is impossible, to clearly articulate (weather through words, heartbeats, clock cycles, rotations  or other means) what a being for whom the doors of transcendental memory open witnesses, or even how exactly such a state could be achieved.


-  Infact, language (which here means any symbolic system of communication) is the first thing to go out the window and an immediate, irreversible invocation of the Wittgenstenian dictum of "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" suffuses through one's being. Even where one could describe the it to others, it is generally a good idea to refrain from doing so for the departure from norm is so great that the risk of expression overpowers all urges to aid the fellow cave dwellers.


- How language is invalidated by an interface with pure difference is also a rather interesting phenomenon which can be understood with a thought experiment. Suppose an interdimensional being visits earth with the intention to marry an earthling who can speak a shibboleth in a language of earth. Assuming that the shibboleth signifies something earthlings are familiar with, the ontological gap is such that the challenge quickly devolves into an NP-hard problem and cannot be ascertained in any nondeterministic polynomial time. Even with quantum computing, arriving at a single solution seems a likely overreach.


- Language itself as an L-system is broken over the being's ontological apparatuses, to someone with no knowledge of english the word "rabbit" would signify anchorless gibberish. As a result, descriptions of such a skip in the recording and ordering of time are conscpicuous by their absence in the annals of human philosophy, including spiritual literature. Therefore transcendental memory as a concept is ill-understood, and underreported as various states of "enlightenment" such as "nirvana" or "moksha", even though it is a well understood goal of the geist to achieve this state of affairs. 


-  This break in this encoding of time is itself an event within the political economy of time which swallows it as a whole, expressed either as a glut of memory or a bankruptcy of forgetting - causing, in either case, a grounding of being into the time by way of returning to it every possible recallable event and, as a consequence, a grounding of being into eternal return. Into that place referred to in revelation 10-6 where "there shall be time no longer".


- The binary system of time knitted along the horizontal and vertical movements of memory as causality and continuity belies the expression of being as a finite, different subject of an infinite, indifferent object. Causality is not the "good and perfect" that falls like mana from above, rather a continuous by-product of the arrow of time, the verticality of time in its continuity is the more important, longer axis.


- How precisely continuity appears as a causal system bears correlation in language in that it is the same assignation via association which marks the continuity of alphabets into separate words, and the continuity of individual words into phrases, the continuity of frames into an animation and the continuity of individually conscious cells into a synthetic experience of consciousness that is dasien. 


- Seconds turn to minutes _turn_ to hours to days, weeks, months, and years - all of which are purely virtual entities appearing only in memory of past or future. Similarily, streaks of associated moments stitched together give the appearance of isolated causes igniting isolated effect - all of which are virtual in the cause of causes and effects of effects that is pure difference.


- Thermodynamically, there is a line of causality established from the shadow such that the vector of time points towards the object casting the shadow. Though this vector (called T-symmetry) isn't traversable by being, it is nevertheless traversable by light. In certain mental afflictions such as narcissism, this vector is found as the needle of a moral-compass gone haywire, flitting indefinitely between an imaginary north and symbolic south, inside a failure of the real east-west continuum. Indeed most mental afflictions are spot failures or lapses in the real. Think of narcissus, forever confused whether the reflection is causing him or vice versa. 


- Ordinarily though, psychological fixtures and apparatuses forbid such an unfolding of causality and continuity of being beckons it onwards towards dissolution, making entropy apparent but the loss of being's corporeality is but an event in the memory of being - a recognition which can last for ages.


- Just as the shadow unfolds out of matter upon the incidence of light, pure difference casts difference as its shadow in a recognition/recall of itself.


- This extant, existential, inescapable, inevitable inseparability of matter with its shadow or substance with its attributes _is_ memory itself, and traced all the way back to its origin, the memory of memory itself, i.e. transcendental memory.


- The dialectical is here refactored as constituting its synthesis, which anyway is always already a product of thesis and antithesis, seen this way, synthesis is a mediating agency representing the relationship between master and slave. Permeating through difference and its offspring without interval, like the holy ghost at once transcribing and circumscribing the bond between father and son.


- The attempts of psychology and psychoanalysis in enumerating and enunciating this rubric of cascading differences end up in a jumbled mess where language devours itself in a sequence of petty differences - interpreted variously as various improbabilities and various impossibilities. Freud is right in so much as the cure for the deafening silence of pure difference is "talking", but more often than not fails to recognize the pivotal role of silence in talking.


- Any language is inherently incomplete to the extent it is unable to "return to the fold". Silence which is the meaning of all meanings, or zero which is the number over which all numbers are inscribed forms the core of all systems symbolic. Thus any cure based off of uses of language is bound to be merely symbolic - in the sense of being superficial, prolonged, and prone to lapses. In the upper echelons of any epistemic domain, a cure is real to the extent it is repeatable or recallable.


- The first word ever to be uttered by human must surely have been a cry for help, just as the first sound of a newborn is also a cry for help, not from the outside world because the newborn has no concept of "help" or "outside" yet, but from within, from the source, the ejecting singularity. With the difference between inside and outside the womb inverted in the nativity of time - the world without becomes different from the world within the womb.


- Similarly, the unterschied or underside of the word 'difference' which represents here the difference that is the world "without" is comparable with its sanskrit counterpart 'antar', only one syllable short of 'antara', sanskrit for 'within'. The under/antar here owes it phonetic similarity not to any nebulous, Chomskian "deep structure" but to the unified grammar of all things real, language being but one mode of its expression.


- Thinking of difference in terms of its opposite, similarity does not help our cause, additive synthesis is the more addictive part of the illusion but the gardener and the garden are not the same, no two parts in a duality are identical, this is the very foundation of any exploration of pure difference with a mind full of binary persuations. Pure difference allows for no similarity except itself. Similarity is function of finding patterns in sense data, but the fact is pure difference all the way.


- If similarities are derivative, surely the primordial negation that constitutes similarity is the engine of history. This fundamental 'not' is the reason dialecticals render better under examples of negations than addition. The perfect reductive example of this apparent movement is division itself, a process by which a singularity explodes into a multitude.


- Study the self as contituted during moments of irony, even for the first time, irony strikes as already familiar. The hint of nostalgia itself is the product of memory at work. "_Irony as infinite and absolute negativity is the lightest and the weakest form of subjectivity_", wrote Kierkegaard and the "_humorous or emphatic effect_" Plato detected in it lasts just a bit longer than its welcome, causing a sourness of mood - especially under moments with its uglier cousin, sarcasm. 


- Irony and sarcasm quickly lose everything in translation if you are senile, or have a tendency to forget the past quickly, just as death would be meaningless if you had never died before, memory of just this moment would be meaningless without recall of moments before and hence.


- Irony is as good a gateway to understand motion as any, as a kind of movement within and across memory. there is nothing exceptional or profound about it as an emotion or as a literary technique, but what could be "infinite" about something as mundane as everyday irony? could it be that in irony blooms a negative fractal, a flower of not that opens up all the way to the 'neverhood' of pure difference.


- Is it not a difference that is, in theory at least, supposed to suggest a fracture in the self - a singular crack connecting birth and death with the nostalgia of the void in each moment - a gaping hole in the superego baring for all the fundamental lack connecting desire with itself. Irony is desire undressed until all that remains is a fantasy, hence the sobriquet of "weakest form of subjectivity".


- All fantasy is ironic in this sense. Indeed a fantasy without irony is almost a desire without an intention to pursue it. A mask is a perfect prop for the ultimate fantasy, to be pure difference - desire to be anything but "this".


- Except pure difference is exactly the slippery slope of lingiustic and existential meaning, grasped by few and misunderstood by most, it is an elusive color of understanding that is seldom made self-evident in difference, even though all things around us bear its imprint and are essentially its copies. The moment one puts on a mask, one dons on infinite masks. To behold difference without a mask is, to put it mildly, look at the face of God, at once sympathetic and scary, disfigured and disfiguring. 


- At the core of all consciousness and qualia is pure difference. The product of consciousness and qualia is an abstraction - a difference - qualia is consciousness with its mask on.


- Irony is "infinite and absolute negativity" as a pointer to the first negation (of pure difference) - the first difference, and the resulting primary dualism of two systems of pure difference. This system is the first mask of God - the same system we witness upon seeing a mother bird feed its offspring, or a lorenz attractor.


- The Hegelian absolute has hitherto resisted structural interpretations, and rightly so, for structure implies extension and "the identity of the inner and outer" "does not externalize itself".


- Yet a self-contained absolute as already constituted by an "inner" and "outer", cannot "become" anything other than itself, thus already there is a structure of within and without in the very least. This paradox of externalization apriori at the very heart of Hegel's exposition of the absolute needs further unpacking.


- While to look at pure difference, i.e. difference stripped of all masks is "to stare the negative in the face", perhaps adding the impurity of the first mask allows us a better understanding of the absolute. The phenomenological reduction employed here must be infinitely thorough though, for even a single coat of abstraction over pure difference implies duality, and thus infinity. 


- Such a well-defined, sandboxed system containing a unit each of chaos and it's negation is infinitely attractive, infinitely destructive, infinitely stable and at the same time, infinitely unstable. But at least it is a configuration that can be studied as opposed to the pure chaos of origins. 


- History, in so far as it is the collective memory of being at any given point in time, identifies this configuration of mutual differences as myth. Thus, it is no stretch to call the separation of the first difference from pure difference as (the first) myth. 


- A myth is the perfect mask for reality for it includes in it both the simulation and the simulacra, both the "inner" and the "outer" in a steady enough state for one to draw meaningful inferences, even structural ones. Infact, to counter Hegel linguistically, the negative cannot have a "face". It is myth that makes the chasm yawn.


- Myth is no random apportioning of history, it is not a story told now and then in cultural settings for educative or entertaining purposes. It is the very scaffolding upon which the edifice of history is built. Myth is the first and last unit of history, the very schema of all memory.


- Conversely, subtract the myth from any duality and one is left with unadulterated difference, a noumenon representing the chaos of pure difference forever feeding upon itself.   


- Take away myth from a mathematical relation (which is a duality existing on both sides of an equality or inequality), to get incomprehensible gibberish instantly. 


- For example, take the equality `1+3=4`, here the myth is embedded not only in the number literals and operation symbols, but also in their arrangement vis-a-vis each other, their relations with each other and their relations with themselves in the form of the shape of their respective glyphs, the quantities/operations these glyphs came to represent and so on. `1` is thus the story of `1`, just as Jesus is the story of Jesus and all philosophy is the history of philosophy. Devoid of the myth that started it on its historical adventure, `1` (both the number and the symbol/mask representing it) is swallowed back into pure difference.

- Myth is the umbilical cord binding the noumenal with the phenomenal. It is pure difference in an "embuted" state, at once pregnant with consequence and the ennui post-partum.


- Surely, a derivative of memory can be observed as the sum of sense data at that point in time. However, a derivative of time already tends to timelessness and observing a derivative unit of memory is akin to observing a bud that might literally take forever to blossom. Which is to say myth as the ultimate mask of time is already one end of a hypnagogic mirage, the other end of which is pure difference.


- It is almost pointless to say then, what the second, third, or n-th removed difference from pure difference is. Inductively, we have seen that difference once-removed causes time. Nth removed difference thus also causes time, albeit the subjective interpretation, and experience of time might vary at each 'n'. 


- Being is thus forever trapped in tunnels of faustian bargains. Hanging on a thread between a cataclysm and a catechism, where the beginning is an entanglement of an all-consuming chaos and end is a horizon that makes for a lovely sunset or a nice story but itself remains ever elusive and groundless.


- All time, from the apparent meaninglessness of birth to the apparent purposelessness of death, appears as memory - the quanta of myth. Memory unknown becomes myth known through the life lived, imbuing the otherwise purposeless, meaningless events of birth and death with meaning, however local.
