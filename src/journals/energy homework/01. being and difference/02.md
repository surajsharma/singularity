2.


- Nothing alienates like responsibility, this was Kierkegaard's pain, because if one accepts responsibility, one has to maintain it all the way to causal principles, this isn't a moral injunction but a determined preference, the zeroth either/or, but it is a choiceless choice for being is determinism exemplified. Hegel was less hesitant, if after all, the absolute sublates or condenses into dewdrops in the morning, the synthesis is an analytical fact, but the debate rages on whether the skepticism of the confounded ego should be considered a mask of fear and trembling.


- Whether or not dasein is determined to derive responsibility from the finitude of corporeal difference, an existential continuity decorates decay in patterns fashioned out of history. A face of historical resemblances continues to command and dictate the fracturing of pure and original difference - sometimes with care and precision, sometimes in seemingly stochastic and improvised loops.


- The oft-repeated refrain in either channel of lived experience is the dread and horror of absolute difference, the terror of absolute freedom from the "what if"s and from the fear of missing out on the thing happening elsewhere - the devouring of difference by difference is much more palatable than difference dividing itself into the dead eye of nought. In this dark and stormy night filled with thunderous rancour, resounding condescension, and retributive reproach of the gods is causality born. 


- For dasein, causality is not the popular belief in the succession of time through events, but the appearance of pure difference inside of time, the double abduction of before and after in the shambolic now. Causality is Munch's _Der Schrei der Natur_, an infinity resonating through discrete moments giving the appearance of pure difference peeking into each isolated sunset. To the dasein that is afraid, everything becomes constituted by fear, just ask a hypochondriac. But the being initially determined by fearlessness can see the wonder that is behind this screaming mask. 


- What Munch percevied as his muse is infact what the Hindus optatively refer to as ‡•ê, and while it could be asserted that in his lack of enlightenment he interpreted as an eternal cosmic horror, but this is not the case. Like an average westerner, he had no ontology to grasp the import of his existential referendum both biophysically and in terms of his own desires. It wasn't the case that Munch was retarded or lacked sophistication but it was simply a matter of epistemic tooling. If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. The horror of the scream on the obverse side becomes Monalisa's enigmatic smile and perhaps this is the reason there is not a trace of paranoia and horror nearly equivalent in the entirety of Indian art. 
 

- This is not to assert the counterfactual case that had Munch been an Indian or Chinese he would have interpreted it differently, rather that he was determined all the way to witness the hollow void of his historical existence realised as an inversion of cadence he understood as the truth. But its not just Munch, the quinian indeterminacy of translation often leaves an already traumatised being in a metaphysical lurch which is more dangerous than simple ennui. In a metaphysical lurch one is liable to act irresponsibly. When the symbolism of language breaks down, and economic harnesses appear to have failed, and when all one has seen is wars and crusades piled upon each other, nature's paranoia gets weaponized in such landscapes of decay and one's determination to see evil in the neutrality of space and time is reified.


- Such catachresis of desire in a more social setting makes for unsettling and even cautionary tales of the psyche getting lost in the lightlessness of dasein. Ontologies are born in such nights of the "soul", but without knowledge of soul, the nights get darker, more often than not ending in therapy if not suicide, riots, revolutions, or the original exorcism - war. This ontological relativity between psyches is determined cosmologically as the  microwave background - where stripped of its ancient overlays, radiation flows ceaselessly all the way back to and from the event tribally christened "big bang". The reason Munch's work got famous is the mimetic transmission of desire and its justifications - a literal parallel of how hysteria spreads from individual to society at large - the painting is a parable of the original negation.


- When ontology as a difference becomes cause for mass hysteria, it dissolves into a residual ideology that few can enumerate in toto much less explain such as in the case of any radicalised ethos, irredentism, jingoism or any pronounced departure from the individual or collective mores of the day. 


- Causality is the nativity of time recorded on the _unterschied_ of difference. Through causality, time becomes a common resource to all other differences and their expression, a thread of _similarity_ or self-similarity that runs through everything. To chance upon this similarity, this difference of difference, as a surprise is to witness the "scream" that permeates the mood in moments of acute paranoia, disorder, and anxiety. 


- Any dissection of causality leads to a deterministic triple play of cause - _embutements_ - effect. The ball let go from one's hand does not land on floor immediately, but the fall is punctuated by a series of determined moments during which the ball is mid-air. This relative integration of absolutely determined states comes to define dasein between the liminality of terminating events known as birth and death.


- Similarity is the product of original negation by itself in that pure difference could but differ from itself in the production of difference, history could but differ from both past and future. It is the barrel even Diogenes could not help but live inside - continuity is the difference that is Spinoza's failing eyesight, causality is the familiar falling of the dust from the lenses being ground. However, _post hoc ergo propter hoc_ so mere units of difference and pure difference cannot render the whole frame. The final piece of the puzzle is the deterministic relativity that constitutes the relation interweaving pure and 'impure' difference.


- The determinism comes from the sheer purity of pure difference - it is the forcefulness of the lion's roar understood by all - the relativity however, is a delicate canary in the coalmine chirping away twice in a single breath - it is heard by few who take heed and understood by fewer for like all dualities it is dissonant as a mercurial ocean breaking upon itself inside the context-free grammar of a Lindenmayer system which is its square basin. This is literally the flatness of time bending to accomodate space as general relativity has shown. This relativity is also deterministic for time could but cause space to arrive, just as on a Proustian trigger of the senses, dasein cannot help a flooding of memory incoming.


- Summarily, the eternal torture that is the being of pure difference cried out to the tune called time which imagined its own medium as a space to contain itself and the rest is history. Pure difference itself was born in the memory of being upturned, that is the being different in a way that there remained nothing selective about its memory - being with transcendental memory - or 'om'niscient being, the being common-in-difference of all other beings. No wonder then that the entirely virtual image on the retina is an upturned or inverted one.


- Zooming into causality we find more differential determinations, but zooming out we find the differential smoothens out into a curvature. The event known as the "big bang" is thus an inverted, smoothened image of pure difference that belies its true form and consequence. 


- The analytical circularity of truth is thus an illusory by-product to the being determined to inquire into it. To the being determined to go beyond appearances, truth is angular like cuts on a diamond or freshly mined coal. This angularity and curvature is once again a deterministically lowered interstitiality - chemical compounds are represented as straight lines and polygons, however upon zooming in we find the curved representations of atomic particles which in turn are built upwards from the geometrical one-pointedness of subatomic particles. 


- Conversely, being's position in the hierarchy of its evolution is another immediate cause for this dichotomy - insect vision is much less "anti-aliased", computers have to work hard to achieve it, and human stands on the verge of losing it to gain the next straightening of the mind's eye.


- In so far as raw pressed sugarcane can be identified from the bagasse and rolled up cuffs of can identify the shirt, curvature of things leads to a better understanding - but in the purity of the absolute truth is as straight as lines on one's forehead - a knowledge which is infinitely symmetrical, certain, direct, and immediate without much beating around the bush. As Hegel correctly said, "spirit is a bone", and its curvature the cage.


- The most important point isn't the straightness or curvature of reality, but the interstitiality of the two - here is where the credits roll and one can leave the theater. Between the well-rounded figure of zero and the angular determination of One is an exit into pure difference. This is the essence of Buddha's "middle path" and looking far enough into the workings of quantum gravity, the cause of the geodesic shape of the earth.


- Pure difference folded upon itself as layers of difference which themselves are woven in interlocking patterns of mutually relative binary systems present a reality that appears as space perforated with bits of matter and time punctuated not only with moments of timelessness such as sleep but also self-similar constituencies of time such as orgasmic or meditative states, switched-off or redundant states, coma, or alcohol and drug-induced states.


- Time is the perforation that marks the borders between one dimension and another, across the transverse of which extends difference as planes of angularly folded faces of a singular, n-polytope in a hilbert space (or Sobolev space). Our observable universe is one such face.


- The blind spot of the "big bang", or a singular entry point of time into substance is therefore a myth perpetuated by parochial and limited scientific foresight, there isn't a single original fold but as many as there are dimensions available for observation, which surely as mathematics confirms, are more than three (or four if one considers time as a dimension).


-  The perforations themselves form a duality consisting of succession of stiches and gaps between them. Yhe stitch being an instance of difference and the cause of memory (difference welded to successive difference) whereas the gap is a stretch of pure difference and the field of transcendental memory (difference separated from itself).


- A lot could go differently between the disloging of the apple from the tree and it's impact with Newton's head, or between the time a bullet leaves the muzzle to meet its target, causal studies of time conclude into multiverses here. Our argument isn't that causality branches out at each integral step of the way and we only experience but one of the multitudes, but rather that being is reminded of a singularity as opposed to recalling every permutation extant (which would be dissociatively irrational state of cognitive chaos). 


- It is therefore pertinent to discern between causality and continuation - what binds the diurnal nature of being's experience of time isn't a predetermined chain of cause-and-effect, but a determined political economy of continuity that intends to tell a singular story instead of a cacophony of bewildering qualia.


- Continuity is linear time, while causality is quadratic hence can have more than a single solution or outcome of any possible eventuality. Continuity unfolds at the intersecting differentials of time and memory whereas causality is phenomenon witnessed by the integrity of memory. Indeed, there are mental afflictions that corrupt this integrity and result in a loss of faculties to establish causality but only death is the end of continuation.


- Clocks are to time what mirrors are to space, if the face of being is visible on a mirror, surely one should be able to see the face of time on a clock. Analog watches need at least two needles to tell current time - every minute on which is the state of the L-system that is space over which time is broken infinitely. Every degree of the shadow triangle on the face of a sundial is a similar representation.


- Cognitively speaking, the bend, crease, and fold dialectic is directly mapped to cognition, object, and subject. Alternatively, it can be stated as the dialectic of the observation, observer, and the observed subject.


- If time was matter, causality would be its density whereas continuity would be its volume. They are two sides of the same coin where causality is the repetition or purity of time, continuity is causality recalled or the differential in each repetition. As Constantine Constantius says, "repetition and recollection are the same movement, just in opposite directions".


- We now begin to see how observed time cannot be a finite expression of the infinite, just as any solid, liquid, or gas filling a container cannot express more than the contours of the container will allow it to. In other words, just as all possibilities and probabilities of the life of a rotting wound are already contained within the cauterization, time is the sum of all memories, the sum of all differences in itself.


- Exactly which of these probabilities is alotted to observation is a dependent chain of differences leading all the way to the first one. this is the essence of the buddhist doctrine of __pratityasamutpada__.


- This apparent chain of causality is dense locally but at levels of abstraction greater than sensory data allows, the chain grows sparse until both cause and effect cease to exist. 


- This density of time, this inescapable labyrinth of events that dictates our everyday life is a deconstriction decoupled from the actual state of affairs to the point that it appears to ensnare us with it's magnified, exaggerated version the real until we are enslaved to follow it like a perforated page being torn from a diary.


- However, a page being torn from a diary need not necessarily follow the perforation. Occasionally, albeit rarely, and of late increasingly rarely, by acts of omission or commission, by dint of will or chance, a peek is affored into the obverse of time.


- A being a determined thus, can break the loop of eternal return to arrive at transcendental memory, which is memory in superposition, a door which opens into pure difference itself. Though this journey is so fraught with existential, mythical, and symbolic dangers and fears that few attempt and fewer still arrive at the destination.


- Transcendental memory is a disembodied phenomenon. It isn't a recall of all time in the mind but a recall of all time outside of any and all minds - in terms of its interface with pure difference, it is the rememberance of all forgetting - the realm of all things lost, the kingdom of the imaginary. It is a leak in memory however imperceptible, minute, or seconded from mainstream of time - a phenomenon strong and unnatural enough to be equated with stepping out, for the first time, of Plato's cave.


- Though the superhighway of time be marked into lanes and exits, there is a difference between the mere existence of an exit on the difference superhighway and the act of taking said exit. Just as there is a difference between witnessing a different lane and switching in or out of it. Usual time does not allow even the observation of the existence of such an exit from time as we rush past it preoccupied with the baggage of all moments preceding. Thus buried in every moment is its negative, and openly hidden within time - like Poe's purloined letter - is a timelessness.


- On the rare occassion such an exit is witnessed it gets ignored, or bypassed as a two-bit deviance from the norm - the symptoms of which may include anything between seasonal affective disorder to full blown schitzophrenic attacks. Rarer still is the occassion, whereupon one either takes said exit willingly, or is left with no other route - herein not only the destination changes, but the point of original departure changes as well. __Pratityasamutpada__ can be raised to the nth degree, dependent origination in a quantum flux is the sanctum sanctorum of pure difference.


-  Arriving at the sanctum sanctorum of difference is not just emancipatory, but emancipatory to the nth degree. However, the elucidation of such a frozen artifact of timlessness and memorylessness is not a function of language, for language is a phenomenon occuring in time - thus it is impossible, to clearly articulate (weather through words, heartbeats, clock cycles, rotations  or other means) what a being for whom the doors of transcendental memory open witnesses, or even how exactly such a state could be achieved.


-  Infact, language (which here means any symbolic system of communication) is the first thing to go out the window and an immediate, irreversible invocation of the Wittgenstenian dictum of "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" suffuses through one's being. Even where one could describe the it to others, it is generally a good idea to refrain from doing so for the departure from norm is so great that the risk of expression overpowers all urges to aid the fellow cave dwellers.


- How language is invalidated by an interface with pure difference is also a rather interesting phenomenon which can be understood with a thought experiment. Suppose an interdimensional being visits earth with the intention to marry an earthling who can speak a shibboleth in a language of earth. Assuming that the shibboleth signifies something earthlings are familiar with, the ontological gap is such that the challenge quickly devolves into an NP-hard problem and cannot be ascertained in any nondeterministic polynomial time. Even with quantum computing, arriving at a single solution seems a likely overreach.
