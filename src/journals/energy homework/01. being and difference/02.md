2.


- Nothing alienates like responsibility, this was Kierkegaard's pain, because if one accepts responsibility, one has to maintain it all the way to causal principles, this isn't a moral injunction but a determined preference, the zeroth either/or, but it is a choiceless choice for being is determinism exemplified. Hegel was less hesitant, if after all, the absolute sublates or condenses into dewdrops in the morning, the synthesis is an analytical fact, but the debate rages on whether the skepticism of the confounded ego should be considered a mark of fear and trembling.


- Whether or not dasein is determined to derive responsibility from the finitude of corporeal difference, an existential continuity decorates decay in patterns fashioned out of history. A face of historical resemblances continues to command and dictate the fracturing of pure and original difference - sometimes with care and precision, sometimes in seemingly stochastic and improvised loops.


- The oft-repeated refrain in either channel of lived experience is the dread and horror of absolute difference, the terror of absolute freedom from the "what if"s and the fear of missing out on the thing happening elsewhere - the devouring of difference by difference is much more palatable than difference dividing itself into the dead eye of nought. In this dark and stormy night filled with thunderous rancour, resounding condescension, and retributive reproach of the gods is causality born. 


- For dasein, causality is not the popular belief in the succession of time through events, but the appearance of pure difference in time, the double abduction of before and after in the shambolic now. Causality is Munch's _Der Schrei der Natur_, an infinity resonating through discrete moments giving the appearance of pure difference peeking into each isolated sunset. To the dasein that is afraid, everything becomes constituted by fear, just ask a hypochondriac. But the being initially determined by fearlessness can see the wonder that is behind this screaming mask. 


- What Munch percevied as his muse is infact what the Hindus optatively refer to as ‡•ê, and while it could be asserted that in his lack of enlightenment he interpreted as an eternal cosmic horror, but this is not the case. Like an average westerner, he had no ontology to grasp the import of his existential referendum both biophysically and in terms of his own desires. It wasn't the case that Munch was retarded or lacked sophistication but it was simply a matter of epistemic tooling. If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. The horror of the scream on the obverse side becomes Monalisa's enigmatic smile and perhaps this is the reason there is not a trace of paranoia and horror nearly equivalent in the entirety of Indian art.
 

- This is not to assert the counterfactual case that had Munch been an Indian or Chinese he would have interpreted it differently, rather that he was determined all the way to witness the hollow void of his historical existence realised as an inversion of cadence he understood as the truth. But its not just Munch, the quinian indeterminacy of translation often leaves an already traumatised being in a metaphysical lurch which is more dangerous than simple ennui. In a metaphysical lurch one is liable to act irresponsibly. When the symbolism of language breaks down, and economic harnesses appear to have failed, and when all one has seen is wars and crusades piled upon each other, nature's paranoia gets weaponized in such landscapes of decay and one's determination to see evil in the neutrality of space and time is reified.


- Such catachresis of desire in a more social setting makes for unsettling and even cautionary tales of the psyche getting lost in the lightlessness of dasein. Ontologies are born in such nights of the "soul", but without knowledge of soul, the nights get darker, more often than not ending in therapy if not suicide, riots, revolutions, or the original exorcism - war. This ontological relativity between psyches is determined cosmologically as the  microwave background - where stripped of its ancient overlays, radiation flows ceaselessly all the way back to and from the event tribally christened "big bang". The reason Munch's work got famous is the mimetic transmission of desire and its justifications - a literal parallel of how hysteria spreads from individual to society at large - the painting is a parable of the original negation.


- When ontology as a difference becomes cause for mass hysteria, it dissolves into a residual ideology that few can enumerate in toto much less explain such as in the case of any radicalised ethos, irredentism, jingoism or any pronounced departure from the individual or collective mores of the day. 


- Causality is the nativity of time recorded on the _unterschied_ of difference. Through causality, time becomes a common resource to all other differences and their expression, a thread of _similarity_ or self-similarity that runs through everything. To chance upon this similarity, this difference of difference, as a surprise is to witness the "scream" that permeates the mood in moments of acute paranoia, disorder, and anxiety. 


- Any dissection of causality leads to a deterministic triple play of cause - _embutements_ - effect. The ball let go from one's hand does not land on floor immediately, but the fall is punctuated by a series of determined moments during which the ball is mid-air. This liminalism of embuted states comes to define dasein between the liminality of terminating events known as birth and death.


- Similarity is the product of original negation by itself in that pure difference could but differ from itself in the production of difference, history could but differ from both past and future, but _post hoc ergo propter hoc_ so mere units of difference and pure difference cannot render the whole frame. The final piece of the puzzle is the deterministic relativity that constitutes the relation between pure and 'impure' difference.


- The determinism comes from the sheer purity of pure difference - it is the forcefulness of the lion's roar understood by all - the relativity however, is a delicate canary in the coalmine chirping away twice in a single breath - it is heard by few who take heed and understood by fewer for like all dualities it is dissonant as an ocean breaking upon itself in the context-free grammar of a Lindenmayer system. This is literally the flatness of time bending to accomodate space as general relativity has shown. This relativity is also deterministic for time could but cause space to arrive.


- Summarily, the eternal torture that is the being of pure difference cried out to the tune called time which imagined its own medium as a space to contain it and the rest is history. Pure difference itself was born in the memory of being upturned, that is the being different in a way that there remained nothing selective about its memory - being with transcendental memory - or 'om'niscient being, the being common-in-difference to all other beings. No wonder then that the entirely virtual image on the retina is an upturned or inverted one.


- Zooming into causality we find more differential determinations, but zooming out we find the differential smoothens out into a curvature. The event known as the "big bang" is thus an inverted, smoothened image of pure difference that belies its true form and consequence. 


- The analytical circularity of truth is thus an illusory by-product to the being determined to inquire into it. To the being determined to go beyond appearances, truth is angular like cuts on a diamond or freshly mined coal. This angularity and curvature is once again a deterministically drawn interstitiality - chemical compounds are represented as straight lines and polygons however upon zooming in we find the curved representations of atomic particles which in turn are built upwards from the geometrical one-pointedness of subatomic particles. 


- Conversely, being's position in the hierarchy of its evolution is another immediate cause for this dichotomy - insect vision is much less "anti-aliased", computers have to work hard to achieve it, and human stands on the verge of losing it to gain the next straightening of the mind's eye.


- In so far as raw pressed sugarcane can be identified from the bagasse and rolled up cuffs of can identify the shirt, curvature of things leads to a better understanding - but in the purity of the absolute truth is as straight as lines on one's forehead - a knowledge which is infinitely symmetrical, certain, direct, and immediate without much beating around the bush.


- The most important point isn't the straightness or curvature of reality, but the interstitiality of the two - here is where the credits roll and one can leave the theater.
