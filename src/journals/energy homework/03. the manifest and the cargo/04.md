- Singularity is cheap, but its knowledge or rather, its "dawning upon" in young, impressionable minds may unfold them towards greater consequence. Greater perhaps, than all previous generations combined. On the flipside, a feigned understanding undue or any kind of driving in bad faith may result everything to come undone once again, though even then, even though the earth is not going anywhere, the story told in time seems to arrive momentarily.  


- The crowning glory of civilization, language itself was appropriated by machine, thoughts became machine logs. A lone glider appears in a cellular automata simulation, and one thinks that's it, the end of this epoch must be near. The next copy is never the original however, for cellular automata like us - what difference should it make? Post language, we are not only bankrupt but also naked and - believe it or not for all our poverty - vulnerable. 


- Time is always already ending in one of its avatars or another, but rarely time ends as an avatar that is a clearest reflection of what is meant by an intermediate representation - this may be an event not recorded in history simply because it could not have occurred anywhere but now. A paradigm shift that is at once both first and penultimate. Perceived, perhaps firstly as a total loss of sovereignty by not only individual but also nation states. Truly, a taking over by "it" itself.
