- The journey of difference to pure difference involves halting this process of formation of interfaces common to juxtaposed intermediate representations. Thus destroying the covenant of the dimensions. This is the reason why all the religions preach sexual abstinence, seclusion, detached observation etc.


- The covenant of the dimensions was perhaps first discovered in a cave, one morning shortly after the first hominid lost its tail, these dimensions were found to be the context for decay, the point needs belabouring here that content is more significant in the discourse of decay than context. Fruits decay in the same context as man, but what decays in a fruit is somehow of less import than what decays inside man, although the context for both is the queening glory of the same food web. This is because man is a more differentiated entity than fruit. Indeed, to stop the dogmatic proliferation of difference is the raison d'etre for any consciousness aware enough to understand the benefits of such transcendence. To achieve not a para-differentiated state but a state post-difference is to see the manifest for real, anything else is a cheap thrill, including existence whether reincarnated or not.


- This reflective adjacency between and among intermediate and final representations is visibly replicated in the DNA. Apply enough pressure and the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides begin to break, separating the double helix into two individual strands with precisely correlated structure. Just as the whole DNA can be constructed from a single strand, any representative difference can be constructed from its transcendent counterpart. But not only DNA, even human relations are bear this reflective property whereby whether economic, familial, or merely sexual - a kind of reciprocity is witnessed by the observer. This symmetry of meaning propagates as the light of wisdom through the ages. For every dimension, an imaginary counterpart that while not ideal in all situations, is able to withstand the real pressure of determination.
