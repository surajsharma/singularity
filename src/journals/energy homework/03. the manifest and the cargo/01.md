- Any attempt at a classification of difference yields a dual-system of difference proposed at the highest level of abstraction as follows:
  - _Absolute differences_ light/dark, order/chaos, motion/rest, one/zero etc. differences that are mutually exclusive, signifying a divergence or repulsion
  - _Relative differences_ can be differences which are complementary, such as space/time, observer/observed, qualitative and quantitative differences etc. signifying convergence or attraction (gravity). Since there is no opposition in pure difference, it is relative unto itself, everything else is relative to it, so even this classification is barely teneble, its only purpose is illustrative of other facts about difference such as the difference between pure difference and difference is at once absolute and relative. Difference decays two-dimensionally, in "L"-Systems throughout the "observable" universe.


- To any balanced observer, the world appears as a thorough on-the-one-hand-this-and-on-the-other-hand-that duality as any assertion of a third category of difference (for the lack of a better word) "discrete" leads to a positive claim on randomness apriori - an analytical circularity whereby we end up referring to discrete differences as a category of differences implying that everything is different from everything else, and if no two things are the same, any "pattern" cannot emerge within or without the observer. If everything is random, nothing is, and vice-versa. This kind of perception of difference as a discrete entity has been psychoanalysed and found at the root of mental disorders such as psychosis. The psychopath suffers from an inability to differentiate between two different units of the same quality - to the psychopath one egg seems not similar but literally the _same_ as another. On a more milder level, this is a tendency to generalize without evidence, binary thinking, halo effects, cults of personality and jingoistic demagoguery are all examples of an inability to clearly discern where one thing ends and another begins. The ability to differentiate and discern is a mark of the superior intelligence, the re-cognition of difference is the root of the episteme. 


- To be sure, pure difference is chaos _sans frontières_, a border is _a_ difference - a sufficient and necessary condition for _impure_ difference to survive. But as dogmatic as this comes across, even in binary systems which rely only on unit difference, it is necessary to maintain a thermodynamic gradient in order for the system to function properly. This inequality is the manifest enumerating the contents of any difference. The ontological being is precisely such a manifest, a difference relative to the epistemic being and opposing the metaphysical. 


- The question is not whether to be or not to be, difference cannot but be. The more pressing concern is the why if not the how. Similarity is the logic of difference echoing across the shallows and depths of pure difference, it is not as if patterns emerge _because_ of opposing and relative differences, but _despite_ them. Randomness is maintained as the source of the will of pure difference to cease to be in as much as it is the cause of it to cease its non-being. The judeo-christian concept of a Judgement day, qayamat, and more historically the norse concept of ragnarok, are perhaps sociological celebrations of this ability of pure will. The excercise of this will is an excercise left for unit difference, not in the least because a collapse of pure difference is the singularity - a self-similarity into which all difference collapse forever, returning to something along the lines of the cosmological time-zero. So physcially there is a forward momentum, not only as a pattern apparent, but a thermal gradient that can be traced exclusive of entropy.


- So, pure difference can but opts out of committing suicide leaving that door open to difference, which means the door to immortality is an equally plausible escape hatch available for difference. But immortality will get us perhaps as far as the outer edges of the milky way for it is also mere substitution of difference (mortality), somewhere on the Scutum–Centaurus arm one will come to the conclusion of the futility of exploration, discovering once again the covenant of the dimensions. Immortality is suicide by other means, the real lived experience is in the death that is hear and now. One of the reasons behind recent trends in prolonging life is this inability to understand, or even fear death. For the  Nietzschean ubermensch a shorter lifespan is sufficient in grasping the import, and continuing to the next stage (if any). Most people live to be ripe in body but remain raw in understanding.
