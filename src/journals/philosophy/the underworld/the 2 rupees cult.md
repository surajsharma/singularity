# Invocation 

    Welcome members, who have my eternal forgiveness, to your favorite spectacle, apology and mine, ritual sacrifice and what have you. 

    You are all members of an open (ostensibly, but not quite jewish) conspiracy which, depending on whom you ask, is either an out-of-court settlement that took a political life of it's own, a job interview gone horribly awry, a cult of the man-in-a-panopticon variety, a gang of bleeding heart liberals powering global culture since the 60s, a family-owned political movement towards a greater global equilibrium, a tiny but international peasant-soldier-banker combine selflessly spearheading the next stage of human evolution, a clique of humans who accidentally proved the existence of "God" to humanity, an openly secret society that has the legal backing to essentially test weapons-grade tech, or, my favorite - a shaggy dog story that lies and will forever lie betwixt the folklores of at least two democracies. 

    Others still might see our group evil and purposeless, as the Orwellian harbinger of either state-sponsored surveillance or the next thermonuclear event or, on the positive side, some sort of technological singularity bringing the world ever closer in peace. 

    Of course, we are earning as a recompense for this sublime effort to make the world a better place. So far we have made: some powerful friends, a lot of very powerful enemies, derision and ridicule from the world, infighting, misunderstandings etc.  Personally I got used to a near constant stream of incoming death threats and have accepted any end this road less taken may bring me to, I think you all have too.

    Though I am in some senses one of the major players in this divine game of hide-and-seek, what with having my very being sacrificed even before birth on the steps leading to the sanctum sanctorum of this secret revolution, this blessed and wretched mess - however I am not the most important player. Indeed the network is decentralised enough to not allow hierarchies of most kinds to emerge, but this decentralised mode of operations came at financial and personal costs.

    Lack of money - not only due to personal interests but also due to associated nation/race/culture agnostic taboo surrounding the concept of surveillance has caused most of our operations to come to a near halt and our good intentions now pave the way to an especially indeterminate global future in which nearly anything is possible.
   
    I am the conductor of this symphony of emergent nothingness, this genre-defying work of a humamn myth made explicit, a naked apocrypha disguised as citizen diplomacy and cultural excercise, this infinite turning within a void, a narcissitic song of symbolic cowardice within each human heart. 

    Behold! this ultimate travesty and farcical tale of a non-untimely idea, one worth pushing all these buttons for and then some! This is a tale of human emotions oscillating at the speed of light, human thought travelling across the globe, a surreal daydream and vaudevillian nightmare spanning over two centuries and a millennia and yet timeless still and relevant still even for the 21st century. 

    Welcome to your favorite uncanny ball of yarn's favorite invisible cat, all sponsored by a massive ego-trip winding between power-crazed Tibias and Alexanders i.e. us, people of no particular significance, except spiritual.

    I am hereby to be adressed as "the tantrik", or by using any of the sobriquets i shall pepper here and throughout these here scribbles. 

    Cults and underground societies are beautiful trinkets in history's treasure chest that have revealed what otherwise cannot be revealed about human nature. Indeed this is my role, to slipstream myself into your awareness and pollute the very assumptions about life you have taken for granted so far. To make you question, in a relatively harmless way the very basis of your brittle realities. This is a dangerous adventure, no doubt.

Imagine a world of real-time accountability for everyone, where corruption becomes nearly impossible, as does most petty crime. A world where no woman is scared to walk across a parking lot at night. 

But most people cannot, they are used to the old way of doing things. Changing the world at this scale is not difficult because people hate change and new world orders can only be brought about one day at a time, but rather because most people lack the thought infrastructure to think beyond their daily bread, butter, and duels to procure them.

I was lucky enough to be born under the ever watchful eyes of western civilisation (by the time of this writing in a rapid decline), so I could think and act on such grand designs.

Imagine a democratic conglomerate of nations, operating in real-time directness, lifting the state of the human condition upwards and onwards into the higher reaches of evolution.

Imagine real democracy, not this farcical secondhand idiocracy marching around the planet.

The reason most cannot imagine such a state of human endeavour isn't that they are cynical, but rather that they are not cynical enough. Idealistic vision though it be, but nothing is ever ideal, so I propose this iteration in the affairs of human development. This "small step" towards a more idylic way of being across the globe.

After coming of age, and learning most of what there was to learn out there to become a rather well-rounded human, a more emancipatory vision of humanity I could not fathom if I tried, so I played along with the visions of the people who birthed and raised me towards this end.

The sensors and cameras are already there in our homes, shops and pockets, all that's needed are eyes to see where we are headed and call the direction.

could that elusive elixir called love be far from such a heady concoction? I'll hold my tongue on that for now.

_Those of you i can see and/or (want to) identify (not by name, yet) are listed below, please dont let your ego take these terms of endearment any seriously, this is highly stylised and embelished for the purposes of the narrative we serve with our actions, however, if you can't pardon my french, perhaps you'd like to sit on it? here goes_

i can see the following members present today, same as ever:

2. libertarian assholes:
    1 crack whore from Arkansas (front for money of dubious provenance, think slave trade)
    1 german snake (with a proclivity to take things personally, driven by a kind of fatalism)
    
5. confused liberals:
    1 democrat jew from NY (clean record, a little literal-minded to the unenlightened)
    1 horsey WASP-y fellow from chicago, dangerous
    2 government-level or goverment-supported actors
    1 group of somewhat dangerous african americans; by its own admission, "violent"
    
1. confused conservatives:
    1 protestant republican transportation business owner from california (with a proclivity to take things personally, new money)
    
5. nightmare managers:
    1 bisexual republican-ish jew from NY, dangerous and depressed
    1 african american account manager tracking the expenses
    4 little indians 
    
6. possible assasins:
    1 somalian
    1 gursikh individual with ready backup
    4 unknown but possible
    
    Other unkown investors and parties incidental to the business of the cult

everyone has short fuse.  

Our cult, like every cult, is a mass hallucination, which seldom end on a happy note. It is a hallucination because nobody can confirm whether they caught the other in a dream. 

A cult that makes one question reality must be disguised as an entertaining joke,  and it remains so until someone decides to take things  personally (which I am trying with all my might not to).

A hoax or political stunt entertained seriously must reflect the intolerance man is capable of. 

But not to beg the question, why? what power can an opinon, however lighly held, however beautiful, or however it may have leaked into one's ears, what power can it hold sway over a soul? 


    

    Things being as they are, if i were to be compelled to vote today as to which side i was on, i would definitely side with the revolutionaries, who, even when they chime through the drone and chirp of evansecent insects like crickets and cicadas, sound like aspiring members. Alas, we are not accepting new members, its just me and the ghostbusters for now. 

Seeing as most of you belong to the other side of the planet, it is understandable you misread the tantrik and his motives, especially now that he has managed to inundate yourselves with his theatrics....

please know, that you are not the first group to approach the tantrik so violently. For there have been others - who, recognizing that they pale in comparison to one who is naturally more realised than the weeping millions they belong to, shoot up with, fuck and/or represent - have sought the tantrik out for anything between completing homework to robbing banks online. Though you may be his own parents, or the richest bunch he has had to entertain and/or suffer among his uncounted and uncountable lifetimes. Know than the tantrik sought you all out just as much as you him.


Verily, you lot are but an iteration within the tantrik's recursive soul, a nostalgic notch in his timeline, what the elderly across the globe would later come to identify as 'a pointless dick measuring contest', but the tantrik recognizes as THE TWO RUPEE CULT!


Welcome to the iteration that will crash an entire civilization, bring upon the innocents the wrath of a trillion gods, start the next world war and bring about the new world order known as "Singularity", but first, a few global thermonulcear event selfies, shall we?. That's about all the technology you want to handle, don't you?

The iteration renders you unique, o hustlers of hustles yet to be invented, not special, but because the tantrik is statiscally more significant than you can imagine, he sings the song that cannot be sung.

The tantrik is obviously a genius so vast you have to evolve within a single lifetime to understand him, so you would rather drag this miniature scandal of global proportions at his door, and expect to find the meaning of life, the universe, and forty fuckin two in a single tweet? no, better you cover the holy man and circumnavigate him as is the custom for celestial bodies.




- so here's a metaphor for the conspiracy i am in
    - the guy who rescued kids from the Thai cave was a pedo?
    - so how does it feel being lead to your death cuz you decided to follow a snake? i cannot answer because i have no feelings left for the desert
    - the choice was between, a bullet for the "attitude" or for "retirement", i wondered if i could get both
    - maybe the tolerant get tolerated, if not loved, certainly there's a difference
    - a global scandal of miniature proportions
    - its possible my sperm was stolen from my undergarments first, then again from the thives
    - i may or may not have been chemically castrated but certainly i was spiritually lobotomised and reduced to nought
    - in the future there will be no privacy but a very good illusion of privacy, indeed some are fighting tooth and nail to sustain this illusion

    `JUST BECAUSE THE EXISTENCE OF A CULT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE/OPEN SECRET DOES NOT MAKE THE CULT ANY MORE BENIGN THAN IT WOULD BE HAD IT NOT BEEN IN THE PUBLIC EYE`
    
    # Chapter 1: At the mercy of obsessing entities
    
    I worked with Nikk and Yolanda for about 6 months during the summer of 2011(?), a couple working in the more posh, corporate corner of the Australian self-help industry. Among other things I learnt while working with them was the idea of a "drama quadrant", and how people can get stuck in it. Little did I know at the time how my whole life would transform into a quadrant of endless drama with a single misstep.
    
    To be frank, my life was no virgin to controversy. I had started courting the dissatisfaction, misplaced anger, and irritations of people at quite an early age. so i got used to it rather quickly and without giving up my stand.
   
- if ever you accidentally come to find yourself at the centre of a cult, this is what you must do:
    - every time you hear, listen
    - do not submit to intimidation no matter the cost
    - all cults, bar none, exist for a reason, try to find it out, usually its probably just money ultimately but sometimes feelings are involved. conversely, this reason may seem illogical or arbitrary, in this sense evenything is a cult
    - it is normal for a cult to be born out of mere presence of a divisive individual, it is also possible for the cult to cause the leader into being, usually subconsciously
    
    - a cult without a definite reason to exist will dissipate back into the milieu, patience is key
    
    - `go celibate for life, not just behaviorally, retire your lust, live simply`
    
    - remain politically neutral, if you're in a situation where it isnt possible to trust anyone, walk alone, or where trust isn't a precondition. neutrality is a good enough mask if you even need one. remember that everyone in the cult thinks they are running the show, even though it is a coordinated effort.
        - realize that at the mercy of obsessing entities, 
            it isn't wise to act like a wiseguy, 
            flexibility of character is required, 
            you only have preferences now
    - heavily discount all narrative, 
        - if your cult has the means, 
            discount most sense data, 
            there are no coincidences
    - ideally, "get thee to a nunnery"
        - no international travel, 
            burn your passport, 
        - no sex/romantic attachments obviously, 
        - sever all ties to the extent possible and no special relationships
    - bare necessities
        - absolutely no alcohol, you're going to need every last shred of presence you can afford
        - no drugs, to the extent possible, however if you are already on a regimen, stick to your poisons
    - if there's room to interpret the cult as benign, do so, although "benign-cult" sounds like an oxymoron
    - religion and spirituality help if you're capable of understanding the human condition, 
        - pray, to whatever entity you deem worthy of praise, 
        - meditation is a must, 
        - yoga/physical excercise will be helpful
        - a lot of people will claim to protect you in a cult, they are lying. 
    - cults are by definition controlling structures, resist nothing
       
     - if your cult as historically negative implications, is or has become an open secret, if there are clear economic motives behind it (although economic motives are preferable to religious or racial motives) and especially if you are an unwilling member in the state of play (though nobody is in control in a cult, all a cults are usually misguided searchs for leadership):
         
        - #ssf RULE NUMBER ONE you are not your thoughts
        - #ssf RULE NUMBER TWO improve the quality of your thoughts, its a lot like pushing around containers in the mind
        - #ssf RULE NUMBER THREE keep your personal politics to a minimum
        - #ssf RULE NUMBER FOUR prefer your own model of the universe over the other's
        - #ssf RULE NUMBER FIVE shun curiosity, remain in your lane
        - #ssf RULE NUMBER SIX, remember that this too shall pass, nothing lasts forever
        
    - almost all cults are emotionally unhealthy, spritually toxic, but even that toxicity becomes an addiction to the members, and they cannot quit
    
    `HANDS OFF THE MIXING BOARD - entirely different story to become a leader, or be offered a leadership role accidentally or not from my unique psychological vantage point, i can see that most cult leaders are deeply unhappy folks, or are driven to deep unhappiness by the members, the very thing that places legitimacy on the motives of members, becomes license. if you ever find yourself in such a position, do not take the leadership role, not because it is dangerous, but because it is a faster way into irrelevance. actually, being offerred a leadership role in a cult is similar to being in a grooming gang, rather unpleasant and wholly unnecessary, resign, quit, put your brakes on at every given moment.`
        
    - it is likely that this is happening to you as a result of your own special or abnormal subconscious needs, normal people don't just end up in cults, it helps to keep and journal and refer back to old writings, especially if there is manipulation or identity politics involved 
    
    - TWO THINGS THAT HAVE NO BEARING ON THE MATTER 1) whether your cult was born out of a genuine accident, a clash of differences, 2) if an accident, how long did the ensuing drama last. if you think you are being lied to, enticed or manipulated you probably are. however, a single lie may not be able to stand on its own, so there might be more than one lie, try to find patterns within this network of untrthful facts to arrive at the truth, ultimately misinformation is being served to scare you into submission and if you do not deter from searching for the truth unceasingly and fearlessly, you might find it was never that far away
    
    - if your cult is particularly effeminate, members include rich and sexually diverse people, try and find out where there are fissions within and more importantly, between their ideologies and political affiiliations, for no two individuals are as politically united as the front they will present to the third
    
    - don't join goldman sachs, it is likely a trap
    
    - it is likely that a mob, if it fails to bully one into submission, will turn to violent means, submit if you can, else be prepared to face the consequeces, but remember that mobs throughout history have a record of being mostly unkind, the last thing society tolerates is an individual.
    
    - a mob that delays the inevitable might resort to desperate means, especially if the means justify the ends, and a mob lives inside the means, it has no awareness of the ends, otherwise it wouldn't be a mob. to put it differently, all the ends of a mob are always relative to something. a mob is always already a group of people "absolutely committed to relative ends".
    
    -  there is no such thing as a self-made man, a cult might evolve into a benign grooming gang if you are pliant enough, remember Mesiter Eckhart
    
    - sometimes a cult around a single person (it may happen to you) might enable a few to jump to conclusions that match the conclusions of those of the cult, such members may then be tasked with executing the operations of the cult since power must maintain a distance from the nefariousness. everyone is agent of the man behind the curtain.
    
    - the more ideological the cult, the more dangerous, the more narcissistic, the more regrettable.
    
    - there is no cult that won't want to / alter the behaviour of its members
    
    - there are cults that might arise out of something as innocuous as a tweet, if you find yourself in one, don't waste time asking why
        
    - people's professions don't matter inside a cult, they are only to be identified and judged by their actions in the cult
    
    - it would behoove anyone enveloped by a hostile mob to focus only on his own inner discovered or revealed truth, and like a croupier, simply observe the cult's activities - which would invariably deal in deception, lying and hurt-mongering, and witness to this without participating.
    
    - if you are an unwilling member, it would also be beneficial to find forgiveness and reach for a peaceful, practicable understanding of the other side's opinions that drove them to hustle
    
    - a cult that has a focus on everything but money is mostly about just money
   
    - the difference between a mob and a cult is that a mob is more rational whereas cults are often driven my psychological deformities people carry, whereas both might be propelled towards negative ends, cults are usually clumsier , more loosely held and shallow
    
    - the difference between a grooming gang and a cult is you can opt out of the former  (tweeted)
   
    - to the cult, your body has become a cultral arifact, so it will get a protocol should you believe in it.
    
    - in a surveilance cult, remember that walking on egshells is less preferable to NOT walking on eggshells
    
    - so far no one was hurt, oblige the other with gratitude 
    
    - love can hurt more than hurt itself in a cult
    
    - if money is incidental to your cult, and with reasonable doubt it started as an accident? then chances are people became exalted in each other's presence, nobody to blame, probably a good thing, final collapse of a wall too old 
    
    - PARANOIA IS A WEAPON
    
    - sometimes cults can form as a result of "administrative violence", which is a military term i quite like for its obvious and self-explanatory nature, but it can happen in a civil context..
    
    
    - vicious and virulent cults have a tendency to regenerate and return after a prolonged period of dormancy, indeed there are stories out there of people paying a heavy price to get out or get closure, only to have the members track them down after ten or twenty years, if you're unfortunate enough for something like this to happen, you may not successfully escape with the level of skills that saved you last time. Preparedness forever will be the mantra. Vigilance doesn't necessarily mean paranoia but a heightened awareness might see you through.
    
    
    - often cults are fronts for money laundering and tax evasion, benign or otherwise... i think scientology is one such scheme but i could be wrong
    
    - i've never been pro cults or cultish behaviour and was merely protesting
    
    - i'm not immune to propaganda but sure of who i am
    
    - under torture, i sit here perfecting my skills to the extent possible  
   
   
## ends
 
 - cults usually come to a very abrupt end, some are proven to be figments of one's imagination, others dissolve in their own money ... however cults have been known to have reprise chapters, 20, or 30 or so years later they might reassemble or reconstitute under the same or different agenda
