## Abandon All Hope

- one thing i think Dante forgot to mention is that nobody leaves the underworld without some sort of mark on the body, whether it be a scar, bullet wound or something of the sort. but that is for those who make it through psychologically and spiritually. 99% give up before making it to the mark.


- it is one thing to enter the underworld, quite another ball game to be born in it


- the underworld is a hell unto itself, and a heaven unto itself, it is a cultural compulsion, and thus cannot be helped. especially among peoples with a strong culture (or a strong lack thereof). 


- the implications of it being 'under' or lately, the general associa$$tion of the term with gangs, cults, secret societies and the adjacent stereotypical darkness - lust, crime, drugs etc - give it a more than serious facade or #narrative, but its darkness needn't be taken seriously at all. for the same principles that apply the "overworld", apply here.


- A normative proof of this congruity is the lietmotif of journeys, pilgrimages, etc. This is true for most civilized cultures. 


- By civilisation i mean any sentience that co-operates. A civilisation may be many-cultured or mono-cultured, that is quite another essay though.


- it is a pity to assume, as is often the reductive logic of late capitalism, to emphasize on economy, or human activity as the connecting link (or driving energy) between the two worlds, however karma has nothing to do with either. two mirrors reflect each other in vaccum as well. karma is simply cognition, everything else is a by-product, biological excreta of conscious processes, something i call #narrative.


- to assume that the world exists out of human intervention or because of consciousness alone is to deny science its due. 


- consciousness and its material ramifications are very much part of the same quantum soup.


- it is the case that the reflection of anything isn't the thing itself. like noumenon and phenomenon in traditional philosophy,the overworld and underworld are reflections of each other - they interface through every medium available to them and on rare occasions new mediums are born out of this interface,perpetuating the dialectical march at the very edge of history.


- however, this difference between substance and ideal IS a difference in perception, hence varies with subjectivity.


- i can go so far as to claim that it is perhaps the only difference between not only two perceptions but also between perception as a noumenon and "self" or "ego" as its phenomenal implementation. 
  

- albeit to invoke qualia entails a regression into ad-infinitum type fallacies.


- if causation appears to precede qualia in the overworld, the same is true for any mind altering cult or psy-ops excercise you might find yourself in the thick of. Dante lived to tell the tale because he understood this much.


- at the horizon, they always appear to be meeting, but somehow manage to never quite do so.


- in simpler words, it is horizons all the way down. what appeared to Dante as the 9 circles are actually infinity-1 and they extend on either side of the manifest (traditionally called substance).


- if then the two worlds are reflections of each other, the relational difference between them is one of simple opposition and mutual invertedness.


- when mystical people  make ado about "evil eye", they generally refer to the underworld, or its domain or influence on another. in practical terms, beyond mere human jealousy, any "eye" is necessarily and precisely as evil as what it sees/records, albeit in inverted terms. 


- adjectives aren't for cameras alone, nor are people in heaven any less miserable, eggshells are sometimes worth more than the yoke.


- If photography is the highest form of alienation, it is because the subject that invented it was alienated in the first place.


- it isn't much of a strech of the imagination to believe the earth to be an underworld of which there is an overworld, just as the planet itself has an underworld (or rather underworlds) of its own - the primacy of such an overworld is asserted by most religions.


- it is a bit of a stretch to imagine the essence of substance to be a photograph of horizons at sunset ad-reductio-infinitum.


- at the core of this recursively diminishing sandwich is the pearl of sentience, unreachable by most humans and all lower lifeforms. this pearl generally referred to as "enlightenment" is a state of cognition in which both heaven and hell are beheld at the same time.


- enlightenment isn't an event in time, but an atemporal interface like the breath between lovers in an ancient lore, like the lack of Bach in any transcription, however soulful and precise. PI can't quite be arrived at, a general idea must suffice. All art is but approximation.


-  it is a *trancendence*, a dislodging from - good and evil, a vertical breaking away from the horizontal. like discovering an axis on a plane hidden with imperative efficiency - like Poe's Purloined letter. 


- nobody that finds this axis ever does so by accident, but if you are born on the edge of history, it surely helps, for enlightenment is also an edge of sorts, it is the edge of *ahistory* - the unrecorded movement of time - in either direction.


- those that gain satori, often have a strong anchoring of the precise moment that they gained satori, Murakami was at a baseball game, Buddha under a tree, someone was doing the dishes etc. and they can often recall with great detail, the time and place. beyond this, this disease-within-disease is uncommunicable.


- there are enlightened beings and divinity even in hell, this is the point of Satan. coming alive isn't the prowess of energy alone, there might be entire planets ruled and populated by the undead, but just because you have access to a door doesn't mean it is to be opened.


- the underworld is a real reflection of hell. which is a purely virtual construct and so on.


- the real/virtual dichotomy isn't a part of the real/imaginary dichotomy, or the real/symbolic binary.


- there is thus a trinity of binary relations for existence (real/virtual, real/imaginary and the real/symbolic)


- enlightenment is the recognition of the unity within this trinity, without which neither may exist, thus real/real, symbolic/symbolic and virtual/virtual, which forms a higher and abstracted trinity of it's own.


- the case is that once you witness this higher, abstracted three-sided nature of power, you can never go back.


- bearing witness to this is akin to looking at source of subjective information, which is essentially mere sense data


- how sense data becomes information that then becomes self or ego is through these trinities, not unlike light passing through a prism making a rainbow.


- to the person that never has seen the rainbow, it may appear as if someone had barfed all over a unity and ruined perfection

  - all whys in one word, are you ready? tweak.
  - existence precedes essence because existence is a customisation, a slight tilt on the scale of non-existence
  - the glory of the world passes in translation
