- "My soul is calm and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they think I am cold, and a mocker with terrible jests."

- Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And to avoid all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!

- Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always steals softly through the night. Shameless, however, is the night-watchman; shamelessly he carries his horn.

- No small art is it to sleep: for its sake must one stay awake all day.

- Blessed are those sleepy ones: for they shall soon drop off.
