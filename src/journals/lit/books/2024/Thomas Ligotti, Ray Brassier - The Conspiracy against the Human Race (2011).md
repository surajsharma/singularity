sublimation is the rarest technique utilized for conspiring against the human race.

At worst keep your startling and dreadful thoughts to yourself.



Bury your dead but don’t leave a trace. And be sure to get on with things or we will get on without you.



Like Pinocchio, Michelstaedter wanted to be a “real boy” and not the product of a puppet maker who, in turn, did not make himself but was made as he was made by mutations that, as Zapffe relays to us from evolutionary theory, “must be considered blind,”



a puppet is only a plaything, a thing of parts brought together as a simulacrum of real presence



exists only relative to other playthings, some of them human playthings that support one another’s illusion of being real.

Michelstaedter could not accept a stellar fact of human life: that none of us has control over what we are



An individual’s demarcations as a being, not his trespass of them, create his identity and preserve his illusion of being something special and not a freak of chance

nineteenth-century German philosopher Philipp Mainländer (born Phillip Batz) also envisaged non-coital existence as the surest path to redemption




the terminal stage of Mainländer’s wishful thought was the full summoning of a “Will-to-die” that by his deduction resided in all matter across the universe




The Philosophy of Redemption (1876).




“We are not everyday people,” he once wrote in the royal third-person, “and must pay dearly for dining at the table of the gods.”




“God is dead,” wrote Mainländer, “and His death was the life of the world.”

namely, worth living. In his Birth of Tragedy (1872), Nietzsche wrote:














The insatiable will always find a way, by means of an illusion spread over things, to detain its creatures in life and to compel them to live on. One is chained by the Socratic joy of knowing and the delusion of being able thereby to heal the eternal wound of existence; another is ensnared by art’s seductive veil of beauty fluttering before his eyes; yet another by the metaphysical consolation that beneath the whirl of appearances eternal life flows on indestructibly—to say nothing of the more common and almost more forceful illusions the will has at hand at every moment.

When the narrator of Joseph Conrad’s novel Under Western Eyes (1911) writes that “the belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness,”














Yes, egoism is good, and altruism is good, and fidelity to nature would be the best of all … if we could only get rid of consciousness. What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. To be part of the animal kingdom under the conditions of this earth is very well—but as soon as you know of your slavery, the pain, the anger, the strife—the tragedy begins. We can’t return to nature, since we can’t change our place in it. Our refuge is in stupidity … There is no morality, no knowledge, and no hope; there is only the consciousness of ourselves which drives us about a world that … is always but a vain and floating appearance.
