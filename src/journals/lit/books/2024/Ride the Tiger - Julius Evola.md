◆ Chapter 1. The Modern World and Traditional Man

▪ age of dissolution

▪ On the contrary, I have in mind the man who finds himself involved in today’s world, even at its most problematic and paroxysmal points; yet he does not belong inwardly to such a world, nor will he give in to it.

▪ The natural place for such a man, the land in which he would not be a stranger, is the world of Tradition

▪ René Guénon

▪ civilization or a society is “traditional” when it is ruled by principles that transcend what is merely human and individual, and when all its sectors are formed and ordered from above, and directed to what is above

▪ little group seems willing to fight on, even in lost positions.

▪ Thanks to them, distances may be maintained—other possible dimensions, other meanings of life, indicated to those able to detach themselves from looking only to the here and now.

▪ those who cannot or will not burn their bridges with current life, and who must therefore decide how to conduct their existence, even on the level of the most elementary reactions and human relations.

▪ The desert encroaches. Woe to him whose desert is within

▪ He can in truth find no further support from without

▪ What kind of relationship can the human type whom I intend to treat here have with such a world

▪ The human type I have in mind has nothing to do with the bourgeois world.

▪ It is good to sever every link with all that which is destined sooner or later to collapse.

▪ Don’t go to the place of defense, but to the place of attack,” might be adopted by the group of differentiated men, late children of the Tradition, who are in question here

▪ The basic ideas to be drawn from what has been said so far can be summarized as follows

▪ Consequently the crisis of the modern world could represent, in Hegel’s terms, a “negation of a negation,”

◆ Chapter 2. The End of a Cycle—“Ride the Tiger”

▪ ride the tiger

▪ if one succeeds in riding a tiger, not only does one avoid having it leap on one, but if one can keep one’s seat and not fall off, one may eventually get the better of it.

▪ the “ox-herding” episodes of Japanese Zen;

▪ Mithras, who lets himself be dragged by the bull and will not let go until the animal stops, whereupon Mithras kills it.

▪ Kali Yuga

▪ We shall now examine the principle of “riding the tiger”

▪ When a cycle of civilization is reaching its end, it is difficult to achieve anything by resisting it and by directly opposing the forces in motion.

▪ The essential thing is not to let oneself be impressed by the omnipotence and apparent triumph of the forces of the epoch.

▪ These forces, devoid of connection with any higher principle, are in fact on a short chain

▪ Resist not evil
