Clouds rise up to the Heaven, the image of waiting. Thus the superior man eats

and drinks, is joyous and of good cheer.

This presents the current situation in its essence. The text then provides a "judgment" which

gives advice: Waiting. If you are sincere, you have light and success. Perseverance brings

good fortune; it furthers one to cross the great water. (Wilhelm, I Ching, 24–25)Clouds rise up to the Heaven, the image of waiting. Thus the superior man eats
