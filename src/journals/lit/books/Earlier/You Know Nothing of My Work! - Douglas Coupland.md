""Terror," he went on to say, is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time… In our long striving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.

(Chapter:… return)

"All that matters is that you’re watching the TV itself, at the expense of some other technology—probably books or the internet"
(Chapter:… return)

> "Marshall’s other cliché, "the global village," is a way of paraphrasing the fact that electronic technologies are an extension of the human central nervous system"
