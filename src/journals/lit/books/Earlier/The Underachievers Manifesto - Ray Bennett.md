# The Underachievers Manifesto
- Ray Bennett, M.D.

## 15 April 2020

- Think globally; underachieve locally.

- Let us all join hands and do less together. Then maybe let’s all take a nap.

> Striving is suffering.

- corporate systems exist for a variety of reasons, and one of them is to keep overachievers from making everyone else look bad while assuring a stable norm

- Underachievers aren’t threatening to others. They’re unlikely to screw up as often as someone pushing for perfection.

- the fastest lane actually makes traffic jams worse.

- Going with the flow keeps the commute smoother and safer.

- Face the facts: you’re probably not going to be a millionaire, so why kill yourself?

- ugly people have good sex, too

- demanding perfection in a partner is a lot like living next to a mental hospital:

> - bad idea to be in a relationship with someone who expects you to keep upping the ante.

- A snack is only a failure if you measure success by the stress-inducing standard of total deprivation"

- No pain, no gain" = no brain
- Index funds are typically more successful

> The key is the wealth ratio: What you HAVE ÷ What you WANT
    - If what you want is modest, what you have is greater by comparison.

> - The more intense the achievement campaign, the more likely and stronger the backlash.

- He doesn’t push himself too hard, so he doesn’t feel the need to drive his family insane, either.

- The problem is the overachievers in those institutions.

> - If the faith of underachievement holds anything to be true, it’s that by not striving to be better than someone else, you’re free to better yourself.

- As Aristotle once said, the mark of an educated individual is to demand no more precision from a subject than the subject itself allows.

- Remember, underachievement isn’t about doing absolutely nothing. It’s about the right effort at the right time, in the right place. And not one bit more.

- You must always work not just within, but below your means.

- If you can handle ten, then handle only five.
