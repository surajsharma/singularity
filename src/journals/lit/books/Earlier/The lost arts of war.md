"He who fights for blood soon finds it dripping from his own heart.
He who fights for glory never lives long enough to hear the victory songs.He who fights for gold is already blinded by the glitter and glare of his own greed, all too soon led astray by all things shiny.
He who fights for sport seldom finds The Gods in a sporting mood.
He who fights for love must leave the one he loves the most behind so he can dance with the one he hates the most.

But he who fights for honor cannot be led astray."
